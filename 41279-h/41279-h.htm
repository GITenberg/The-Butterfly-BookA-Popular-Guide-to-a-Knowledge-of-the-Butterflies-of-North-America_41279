<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>At some time or other in the life of every healthy young person
there appears to be developed what has been styled
"the collecting mania." Whether this tendency is due to the
natural acquisitiveness of the human race, to an innate appreciation
of the beautiful and the curious, or to the development of an
instinct such as is possessed by the bower-bird, the magpie, and
the crow, which have the curious habit of gathering together and
storing away trifles which are bright and attractive to the eye, I
leave to students of the mind to decide. The fact is patent that
there is no village without its youthful enthusiast whose collection
of postage-stamps is dear to his heart, and no town in which
there are not amateur geologists, arch&aelig;ologists, botanists, and
zo&ouml;logists, who are eagerly bent upon the formation of collections
of such objects as possess an attraction for them.</p>

<p>One of the commonest pursuits of boyhood is the formation
of a collection of insects. The career of almost every naturalist
of renown has been marked in its early stages by a propensity
to collect these lower, yet most interesting and instructive, forms
of animal life. Among the insects, because of their beauty,
butterflies have always held a foremost place in the regard of
the amateur collector. For the lack, however, of suitable instruction
in the art of preserving specimens, and, above all, by
reason of the almost entire lack of a convenient and well-illustrated
manual, enabling the collector to identify, name, and
properly classify the collections which he is making, much of
the labor expended in this direction in the United States and
Canada fails to accomplish more than the furnishing of temporary
recreation. It is otherwise in Europe. Manuals, comprehensive
in scope, and richly adorned with illustrations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[ vi]</a></span>
leading insect forms of Great Britain and the Continent, have been
produced in great numbers in recent years in England, France,
and Germany. The result is that the youthful collector enters the
field in those countries in the possession of a vast advantage over
his less fortunate American fellow. It is to meet this want on
this side of the Atlantic that this volume has been written. Its
aim is to guide the amateur collector in right paths and to prepare
him by the intelligent accomplishment of his labors for the
enjoyment of still wider and more difficult researches in this and
allied fields of human knowledge. The work is confined to the
fauna of the continent of North America north of the Rio Grande
of Texas. It is essentially popular in its character. Those who
seek a more technical treatment must resort to the writings of
others.</p>

<p>If I shall succeed in this book in creating a more wide-spread
interest in the world of insect life and thereby diverting attention
in a measure from the persecuted birds, which I love, but which
are in many species threatened with extinction by the too eager
attentions which they are receiving from young naturalists, who
are going forth in increased numbers with shot-gun in hand, I
think I shall render a good service to the country.</p>

<p>I flatter myself that I have possessed peculiar facilities for the
successful accomplishment of the undertaking I have proposed to
myself, because of the possession of what is admitted to be undoubtedly
the largest and most perfect collection of the butterflies
of North America in existence, containing the types of W.H. Edwards,
and many of those of other authors. I have also enjoyed
access to all the other great collections of this country and Europe,
and have had at my elbow the entire literature relating to the
subject.</p>

<p>The successful development in recent months of the process of
reproducing in colors photographic representations of objects has
been to a certain degree the argument for the publication of this
book at the present time. A few years ago the preparation of
such a work as this at the low price at which it is sold would
have been an utter impossibility. "The Butterflies of North
America," by W.H. Edwards, published in three volumes, is
sold at one hundred and fifty dollars, and, as I know, is sold even
at this price below the cost of manufacture. "The Butterflies of
New England," by Dr. S.H. Scudder, in three volumes, is sold
at seventy-five dollars, and likewise represents at this price only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[ vii]</a></span>
a partial return to the learned author for the money, labor, and
time expended upon it. The present volume, while not pretending
to vie in any respect with the magnificence of the illustrations
contained in these beautiful and costly works, nevertheless presents
in recognizable form almost every species figured in them,
and in addition a multitude of others, many of which have
never before been delineated. So far as possible I have employed,
in making the illustrations, the original types from which
the author of the species drew his descriptions. This fact will no
doubt add greatly to the value of the work, as it will not only
serve as a popular guide, but have utility also for the scientific
student.</p>

<p>I am under obligations to numerous friends and correspondents
who have aided me, and take the present opportunity to extend
to them all my hearty thanks for the generous manner in which
they have assisted me in my pleasant task. I should fail, however,
to follow the instincts of a grateful heart did I not render an
especial acknowledgment to Mr. W.H. Edwards, of Coalburg,
West Virginia, and Dr. Samuel H. Scudder, of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Justly esteemed as the two foremost lepidopterists of
America, it is my honor to claim them as personal friends, whose
kindness has much aided me in this labor of scientific love which
I have undertaken. For the kind permission given me by Dr.
Scudder to use various illustrations contained in the "Butterflies
of New England" and other works, I am profoundly grateful.</p>

<p>I am under obligations to Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons for
permission to use the cuts numbered 46-49, 51-56, 59, 61, 62,
and 73, which are taken from the work entitled "Taxidermy and
Zo&ouml;logical Collecting," by W.T. Hornaday, and to the authorities
of the United States National Museum and the heirs of the late
Professor C.V. Riley for other illustrations.</p>

<p>Should this book find the favor which I have reason to think it
deserves, I shall endeavor shortly to follow it by the preparation
of a similar work upon the moths of the United States and Canada.</p>

<h3>THE LIFE-HISTORY AND ANATOMY OF BUTTERFLIES</h3>

<blockquote><p>"The study of butterflies,&mdash;creatures selected as the types of airiness and frivolity,&mdash;instead
of being despised, will some day be valued as one of the most important
branches of biological science."<span class="smcap">&mdash;Bates</span>, <i>Naturalist on the Amazons</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>In studying any subject, it is always well, if possible, to commence
at the beginning; and in studying the life of animals, or of
a group of animals, we should endeavor to obtain a clear idea at
the outset of the manner in which they are developed. It is a
familiar saying that "all life is from an egg." This statement is
scientifically true in wide fields which come under the eye of the
naturalist, and butterflies are no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>The eggs of butterflies consist of a membranous shell containing
a fluid mass composed of the germ of the future caterpillar
and the liquid food which is
necessary for its maintenance and development
until it escapes from the
shell. The forms of these eggs are
various. Some are spherical, others
hemispherical, conical,
and cylindrical.
Some are barrel-shaped;
others
have the shape of
a cheese, and still
others have the
form of a turban. Many of them are angled, some depressed
at the ends. Their surface is variously ornamented. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[ 4]</a></span>times
they are ribbed, the ribs running from the center outwardly
and downwardly along the sides like the meridian lines
upon a globe. Between
these ribs there is frequently
found a fine
network of raised lines
variously arranged.
Sometimes the surface
is covered with
minute depressions,
sometimes with a
series of minute elevations
variously disposed. As there is
great variety in the form of the eggs, so
also there is great variety in their
color. Brown, blue, green, red, and
yellow eggs occur. Greenish or
greenish-white are common tints.
The eggs are often ornamented with
dots and lines of darker color. Species
which are related to one another show
their affinity even in the form of their
eggs. At the upper end of the eggs of insects there are one or
more curious structures, known as micropyles (little doors),
through which the spermatozoa of the male find ingress and they
are fertilized. These can only be seen under a good microscope.</p>

<p>The eggs are laid upon the food-plant upon which the cater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[ 5]</a></span>pillar,
after it is hatched, is destined to live, and the female reveals
wonderful instinct in selecting plants which are
appropriate to the development
of the larva. As a
rule, the larv&aelig; are restricted in
the range of their food-plants to
certain genera, or families of
plants.</p>

</div>

<p>The eggs are deposited
sometimes singly, sometimes
in small clusters, sometimes
in a mass. Fertile eggs, a few
days after they have been deposited, frequently undergo a change
of color, and it is often possible with a magnifying-glass to see
through the thin shell the form of the minute caterpillar which is
being developed within the egg. Unfruitful eggs generally
shrivel and dry up after the lapse of a short time.</p>

<p>The period of time requisite for the development
of the embryo in the egg varies. Many butterflies
are single-brooded; others produce two or three generations
during the summer in temperate climates,
and even more generations in subtropical or tropical
climates. In such cases an interval of only a few
days, or weeks at the most, separates the time when
the egg was deposited and the time when the larva
is hatched. When the period of hatching, or emergence,
has arrived, the little caterpillar cuts its way
forth from the egg through an opening made either
at the side or on the top. Many species have eggs which appear to be
provided with a lid, a portion of the shell being separated from the remainder
by a thin section, which, when the caterpillar has reached the
full limit allowed by the egg, breaks under the pressure of the enlarging
embryo within, one portion of the egg flying off, the remainder
adhering to the leaf or twig upon which it has been deposited.</p>

<p><i>Structure, Form, Color, etc.</i>&mdash;The second stage in which the
insects we are studying exist is known as the larval stage. The
insect is known as a larva, or a caterpillar. In general cater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6]</a></span>pillars
have long, worm-like bodies. Frequently they are
thickest about the middle, tapering before and behind, flattened
on the under side. While the
cylindrical shape is most common, there
are some families in which the larv&aelig;
are short, oval, or slug-shaped, sometimes
curiously modified by ridges and prominences.
The body of the larv&aelig; of lepidoptera
consists normally of thirteen rings,
or segments, the first constituting the
head.</p>

</div>

<p>The head is always conspicuous, composed
of horny or chitinous material,
but varying exceedingly in form and
size. It is very rarely small and retracted.
It is generally large, hemispherical,
conical, or bilobed. In some families it
is ornamented by horn-like projections.
On the lower side are the mouth-parts,
consisting of the upper lip, the mandibles,
the antenn&aelig;, or feelers, the under lip, the
maxill&aelig;, and two sets of palpi, known as
the maxillary and the labial palpi. In
many genera the labium, or under lip, is provided with a
short, horny projection known as the spinneret, through
which the silk secreted by the caterpillar
is passed. On either side,
just above the mandibles,
are located the
eyes, or ocelli, which
in the caterpillar are
simple, round, shining
prominences, generally
only to be clearly distinguished
by the aid
of a magnifying-glass.
These ocelli are frequently
arranged in series on each side. The palpi are organs
of touch connected with the maxill&aelig; and the labium, or under
lip, and are used in the process of feeding, and also when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[ 7]</a></span>
caterpillar is crawling about from place to place. The larva
appears to guide itself in great part by means of the palpi.</p>

<p>The body of the caterpillar is covered by a thin skin, which
often lies in wrinkled folds, admitting of great freedom of
motion. The body is composed, as we have seen, of rings, or
segments, the first three of which, back of the head, correspond
to the thorax of the perfect insect, and the last nine to the abdomen
of the butterfly. On each ring, with the exception of the second,
the third, and the last, there is found on either side a small oval
opening known as a spiracle, through which the creature breathes.
As a rule, the spiracles of the first and eleventh rings are larger in
size than the others.</p>

butterfly (Riley).</span>
</div>

<p>Every caterpillar has on each of the first three segments a pair
of legs, which are organs composed of three somewhat horny
parts covered and bound together with skin, and armed at their
extremities by a sharp claw (Fig. 17). These three pairs of feet
in the caterpillar are always known as the fore legs, and correspond
to the six which are found in the butterfly or the moth.
In addition, in most cases, we find four pairs of prolegs on
the under side of the segments from the sixth to the ninth,
and another pair on the last segment, which latter pair are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[ 8]</a></span>
called the anal prolegs. These organs, which are necessary to
the life of the caterpillar, do not reappear in the perfect insect, but
are lost when the transformation from the caterpillar to the
chrysalis takes place. There are various modifications of this
scheme of foot-like appendages, only the larger and more highly
developed forms of lepidoptera having as many pairs of prolegs
as have been enumerated.</p>

<p>The bodies of caterpillars are variously ornamented: many
of them are quite smooth; many are provided with horny
projections, spines, and eminences. The coloration of caterpillars
is as remarkable in the
variety which it displays as is
the ornamentation by means
of the prominences of which
we have just spoken. As
caterpillars, for the most part,
feed upon growing vegetation,
multitudes of them are
green in color, being thus
adapted to their surroundings
and securing a measure of
protection. Many are brown, and exactly mimic the color of the
twigs and branches upon which they rest when not engaged in
feeding. Not a few are very gaily colored, but in almost every
case this gay coloring is found to bear some relation to the color
of the objects upon which they rest.</p>

<p>Caterpillars vary in their social habits. Some species are
gregarious, and are found in colonies. These frequently build
for themselves defenses, weaving webs of silk among the
branches, in which they are in part protected from their enemies
and also from the inclemencies of the weather. Most caterpillars
are, however, solitary, and no community life is maintained by
the vast majority of species. Many species have the habit of
drawing together the edges of a leaf, in which way they form
a covering for themselves. The caterpillars of some butterflies
are wood-boring, and construct tunnels in the pith, or
in the soft layers of growing plants. In these cases, being
protected and concealed from view, the caterpillars are generally
white in their coloration, resembling in this respect the
larv&aelig; of wood-boring beetles. A most curious phenomenon has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[ 9]</a></span>
within comparatively recent years been discovered in connection
with the larval stage of certain small butterflies belonging to
the family <i>Lyc&oelig;nid&oelig;</i>. The caterpillars are carnivorous, or rather
aphidivorous; they live upon aphids, or plant-lice, and scale-insects,
and cover
themselves with the
white exudations or
mealy secretions of
the latter. This trait
is characteristic of
only one of our North
American species, the
Harvester (<i>Feniseca
tarquinius</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>In addition to
being protected from
enemies by having
colors which enable
them to elude observation,
as has been
already stated, some
caterpillars are provided
with other
means of defense.
The caterpillars of the
swallowtail butterflies
are provided with a bifurcate or forked organ, generally
yellow in color, which is protruded from an opening in the skin
back of the head, and which emits a powerful
odor (Fig. 22). This protrusive organ evidently
exists only for purposes of defense, and the secretion
of the odor is analogous to the secretion
of evil odors by some of the vertebrate animals,
as the skunk. The majority of caterpillars,
when attacked by insect or other enemies,
defend themselves by quickly hurling the anterior
part of the body from side to side.</p>

troilus</i>, with

</div>

<p><i>Moults.</i>&mdash;Caterpillars in the process of growth and development
from time to time shed their skins. This process is called
<i>moulting</i>. Moulting takes place, as a rule, at regular intervals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10]</a></span>
though there are exceptions to this rule. The young larva, having
emerged from the egg, grows for a number of days, until the
epidermis, or true skin, has become too small. It then ceases
feeding, attaches itself firmly to some point, and remains quiet for
a time. During this period certain changes are taking place, and
then the skin splits along the middle line from the head to the
extremity of the last segment, and the caterpillar crawls forth from
the skin, which is left behind it, attached to the leaf or branch to
which it was fastened. The skin of the head sometimes remains
attached to the head of the caterpillar for a time after it has
moulted, and then falls off to the ground. Ordinarily not more
than five, and frequently only four, moults take place between
hatching from the egg and the change into the chrysalis. In cases
where caterpillars hibernate, or pass the winter in inaction, a long
interval necessarily elapses between moults. Some arctic species
are known in which the development from the egg to the perfect
insect covers a period of two or three years, long periods of
hibernation under the arctic snows taking place. The manner in
which the caterpillar withdraws itself from its exuvi&aelig;, or old skin,
is highly interesting. Every little spine or rough prominence is
withdrawn from its covering, and the skin is left as a perfect cast
of the creature which has emerged from it, even the hairs and
spines attached to the skin being left behind and replaced by
others.</p>

<p><i>The Food of the Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The vast majority of the caterpillars
of butterflies subsist upon vegetable food, the only exceptions
being the singular one already noted in which the larv&aelig;
feed upon scale-insects. Some of the <i>Hesperiid&aelig;</i>, a group in
which the relationship between butterflies and moths is shown,
have larv&aelig; which burrow in the roots and stems of vegetation.</p>

<p><i>Duration of the Larval State.</i>&mdash;The duration of the larval state
varies greatly. In temperate climates the majority of species exist
in the caterpillar state for from two to three months, and where
hibernation takes place, for ten months. Many caterpillars which
hibernate do so immediately after emerging from the egg and before
having made the first moult. The great majority, however,
hibernate after having passed one or more moults. With the
approach of spring they renew their feeding upon the first reappearance
of the foliage of their proper food-plant, or are transformed
into chrysalids and presently emerge as perfect insects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11]</a></span>
A few species live gregariously during the period of hibernation,
constructing for themselves a shelter of leaves woven together
with strands of silk.</p>

<p><i>Transformation.</i>&mdash;The larval or caterpillar stage having been
completed, and full development having been attained, the caterpillar
is transformed into a pupa, or chrysalis. Of this, the third
stage in the life of the insect, we now shall speak at length.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>THE PUPA, OR CHRYSALIS</b></p>

<p>The caterpillars of many butterflies attach themselves by a
button of silk to the under surface of a branch or stone, or
other projecting surface, and are transformed into chrysalids,
which are naked, and which hang perpendicularly from the surface
to which they are attached. Other caterpillars attach themselves
to surfaces by means of a button of silk which holds the
anal extremity of the chrysalis, and have, in addition, a girdle of
silk which passes around the middle of the chrysalis, holding it
in place very much as a papoose is held on the back of an Indian
squaw by a strap passed over her shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

segments, while with the cremaster, armed with microscopic
hooks, it searches for the button of silk from which it is to
hang (Riley). (Compare Fig. 24, showing final form of the
chrysalis.)</span>
</div>

<p><i>The Form of Chrysalids.</i>&mdash;The forms assumed by the insect
in this stage of its being vary very greatly, though there is a general
resemblance among the different families and subfamilies, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12]</a></span>
it is easy for one who has studied the matter to tell approximately
to what family the form belongs, even when it is not specifically
known. Chrysalids are in most cases obscure in coloring, though
a few are quite brilliant, and, as in the case of the common milkweed
butterfly (<i>Anosia plexippus</i>), ornamented with golden-hued
spots. The chrysalids of the <i>Nymphalid&aelig;</i>, one of the largest
groups of butterflies, are all suspended. The chrysalids of the
<i>Papilionid&aelig;</i>, or swallowtail butterflies, are held in place by girdles,
and generally are bifurcate or cleft at the upper end (Fig. 25), and
are greenish or wood-brown in color.</p>

</div>

<p>A study of the structure of all chrysalids shows that within
them there is contained the immature butterfly. The segments of
the body are ensheathed in the corresponding segments of the
chrysalis, and soldered
over these segments are
ensheathing plates of
chitinous matter under
which are the wings of
the butterfly, as well as all
the other organs necessary
to its existence in the
airy realm upon which it
enters after emergence
from the chrysalis. The
practised eye of the observer
is soon able to distinguish the location of the various parts
of the butterfly in the chrysalis, and when the time for escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[ 13]</a></span>
draws near, it is in many cases possible to discern through the
thin, yet tough and hard, outer walls of the chrysalis the spots and
colors on the wings of the insect.</p>

(Riley.)</span>
</div>

<p><i>Duration of Pupal Life.</i>&mdash;Many butterflies remain in the chrysalis
stage only for a few weeks; others hibernate in this state, and
in temperate climates a great many butterflies pass the winter as
chrysalids. Where, as is sometimes the case, there are two or
three generations or broods of a species during the year, the life
of one brood is generally longer than that of the
others, because this brood is compelled to overwinter,
or hibernate. There are a number of butterflies
known in temperate North America which
have three broods: a spring brood, emerging from
chrysalids which have overwintered; an early summer
brood; and a fall brood. The chrysalids in the
latter two cases generally represent only a couple
of weeks at most in the life of the insect. In
tropical and semi-tropical countries many species remain
in the chrysalis form during the dry season, and emerge at
the beginning of the rains, when vegetation is refreshed and new
and tender growths occur in the forests.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 28.</a>&mdash;Butterfly
(<i>Papilio
asterias</i>) just

</div>

<p><i>The Transformation from the Chrysalis to the Imago.</i>&mdash;The
perfectly developed insect is known technically as the <i>imago</i>.
When the time of maturity in the chrysalis state has been reached,
the coverings part in such a way as to allow of the
escape of the perfect insect, which, as it comes
forth, generally carries with it some suggestion of
its caterpillar state in the lengthened abdomen,
which it with apparent difficulty trails after it until
it secures a hold upon some object from which
it may depend while a process of development
(which lasts generally a few hours) takes place preparatory
to flight. The imago, as it first emerges,
is provided with small, flaccid wings, which, together
with all the organs of sense such as the
antenn&aelig;, require for their complete development
the injection into them of the vital fluids which,
upon first emergence, are largely contained in the
cavities of the thorax and abdomen. Hanging pendant on a projecting
twig, or clinging to the side of a rock, the insect remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14]</a></span>
fanning its wings, while by the strong process of circulation a
rapid injection of the blood into the wings and other organs takes
place, accompanied by their expansion to normal proportions, in
which they gradually attain to more or less rigidity. Hardly anything
in the range of insect life is more interesting than this rapid
development of the butterfly after its first emergence from the
chrysalis. The body is robbed of its liquid contents in a large
degree; the abdomen is shortened up; the chitinous rings which
compose its external skeleton become set and hardened; the
wings are expanded, and then the moment arrives when, on airy
pinions, the creature that has lived a worm-like life for weeks
and months, or which has been apparently sleeping the sleep of
death in its cerements, soars aloft in the air, the companion of
the sunlight and the breezes.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Head.</i>&mdash;The head is globular, its breadth generally exceeding
its length. The top is called the <i>vertex</i>; the anterior portion,
corresponding in location to
the human face, is called
the <i>front</i>. Upon the sides
of the head are situated the
large <i>compound eyes</i>, between
which are the <i>antenn&aelig;</i>, or
"feelers," as they are sometimes
called. Above the
mouth is a smooth horny
plate, the <i>clypeus</i>. The <i>labrum</i>,
or upper lip, is quite
small. On both sides of the
mouth are rudimentary <i>mandibles</i>,
which are microscopic
objects. The true suctorial
apparatus is formed by the
<i>maxill&aelig;</i>, which are produced in the form of semi-cylindrical
tubes, which, being brought together and interlocking, form a com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15]</a></span>plete
tube, which is known as the <i>proboscis</i>, and which, when not
in use, is curled up spirally, looking like a watch-spring. At
the upper end of the proboscis, in the head, is a bulb-like enlargement,
in the walls of which are inserted muscles which have
their origin on the inner wall of the head. When these muscles
contract, the bulb-like cavity is enlarged, a vacuum is produced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16]</a></span>
and the fluids in the cup of the flower flow up the proboscis and
into the bulb. The bulb is also surrounded by muscles, which,
when contracting, compress it. The external opening of the
tube has a flap, or valve, which, when the bulb is compressed,
closes and causes the fluid in it to flow backward into the gullet
and the stomach. The arrangement is mechanically not unlike
that in a bulb-syringe used by physicians. The process of feeding
in the case of the butterfly is a process of pumping
honeyed water out of the flowers into the stomach.
The length of the proboscis varies; at its base and on
either side are placed what are known as the maxillary
palpi, which are very small. The lower lip, or <i>labium</i>,
which is also almost obsolete in the butterflies,
has on either side two organs known as the <i>labial
palpi</i>, which consist of three joints. In the butterflies
the labial palpi are generally well developed,
though in some genera they are quite small. The
antenn&aelig; of butterflies are always provided at the extremity
with a club-shaped enlargement, and because
of this clubbed form of the antenn&aelig; the entire group are known
as the <i>Rhopalocera</i>, the word being compounded from the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[ 17]</a></span>
word (&#8165;&#959;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#957;), which means a <i>club</i>, and the word &#954;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#950;
(<i>keras</i>) which means a <i>horn</i>.</p>

<p>It will be observed from what has been said that the head in
these creatures is to a large extent the seat of the organs of sense
and alimentation. What the function of the antenn&aelig; may be is
somewhat doubtful, the opinion of scientific men being divided.
The latest researches would indicate that these organs, which
have been regarded as the organs of smell and sometimes
as the organs of hearing, have probably a compound function,
possibly enabling the creature to hear, certainly to smell, but also,
perhaps, being the seat of impressions which are not strictly like
any which we receive through our senses.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Thorax.</i>&mdash;The thorax is more or less oval in form, being
somewhat flattened upon its upper surface. It is composed of
three parts, or segments, closely united, which can only be distinguished
from one another by a careful dissection. The anterior
segment is known as the prothorax, the
middle segment as the mesothorax, and the
after segment as the metathorax. The legs
are attached in pairs to these three subdivisions
of the thorax, the anterior pair being
therefore sometimes spoken of as the prothoracic
legs, the second pair as the mesothoracic
legs, and the latter pair as the
metathoracic legs (Fig. 34). On either
side of the mesothorax are attached the
anterior pair of wings, over which, at
their insertion into the body, are the <i>tegul&aelig;</i>, or lappets; on either
side of the metathorax are the posterior pair of wings. It will
be seen from what has been said that the thorax
bears the organs of locomotion. The under side
of the thorax is frequently spoken of by writers,
in describing butterflies, as the <i>pectus</i>, or breast.</p>

<p><i>The Abdomen.</i>&mdash;The abdomen is formed normally
of nine segments, and in most butterflies
is shorter than the hind wings. On the last segment
there are various appendages, which are
mainly sexual in their nature.</p>

first of which, nearest the body, is called the <i>coxa</i>, with
which articulates a ring-like piece known as the <i>trochanter</i>. To
this is attached the <i>femur</i>, and united with the femur, forming
an angle with it, is the <i>tibia</i>. To the tibia is attached the <i>tarsus</i>,
or foot, the last segment of which bears the claws, which are often
very minute and blunt in the butterflies, though in moths they are
sometimes strongly hooked. The tibi&aelig; are often armed with
spines. In some groups of butterflies the anterior pair of legs is
aborted, or dwarfed, either in one or both sexes, a fact which is
useful in determining the location of species in their systematic
order.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Wings.</i>&mdash;The wings of butterflies consist of a framework
of horny tubes which are in reality double, the inner tube being
filled with air, the outer tube with blood, which circulates most
freely during the time that the insect is undergoing the process of
development after emergence from the chrysalis, as has been already
described. After emergence the circulation of the blood in the
outer portion of the tubes is largely, if not altogether, suspended.
These horny tubes support a broad membrane, which is clothed
in most species upon both sides with flattened scales which are
attached to the membrane in such a way that they overlap one
another like the shingles on a roof. These scales are very beautiful
objects when examined under a microscope, and there is
considerable diversity in their form as well as in their colors. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[ 19]</a></span>
males of many species have peculiarly shaped scales arranged in
tufts and folds, which are called androconia, and are useful in
microscopically determining species (Fig. 37). The portion of the
wings which is nearest to the thorax at the point where they are
attached to the body is called the <i>base</i>; the middle third of the wing
is known as the <i>median</i> or <i>discal area</i>, the outer third as the <i>limbal
area</i>. The anterior margin of the wings is called the <i>costal margin</i>;
the outer edge is known as the <i>external margin</i>, the inner edge
as the <i>inner margin</i>. The shape of the wings varies very much.
The tip of the front wing is called the apex, and this may be
rounded, acute, falcate (somewhat sickle-shaped), or square. The
angle formed by the outer margin of the front wing with the inner
margin is commonly known as the <i>outer angle</i>. The corresponding
angle on the hind wing is known as the <i>anal angle</i>, and the
point which corresponds to the tip or apex of the front wing is
known as the <i>external angle</i> (Fig. 38). A knowledge of these
terms is necessary in order to understand the technical descriptions
which are given by authors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a></span></div>

<p>If a wing is examined with the naked eye, or even with a lens,
a clear conception of the structure of the veins can rarely be
formed. Therefore it is generally necessary to remove from the
wings the scales which cover them, or else bleach them. The
scales may be removed mechanically by rubbing them off. They
may be made transparent by the use of chemical agents. In the
case of specimens which are so valuable as to forbid a resort to
these methods, a clear knowledge of the structure of the veins
may be formed by simply moistening them with pure benzine or
chloroform, which enables the structure of the veins to be seen
for a few moments. The evaporation of these fluids is rapid, and
they produce no ill effect upon the color and texture of the wings.
In the case of common species, or in the case of such as are abundantly
represented in the possession of the collector, and the
practical destruction of one or two of which is a matter of no
moment, it is easy to use the first method. The wing should be
placed between two sheets of fine writing-paper which have been
moistened by the breath at the points where the wing is laid, and
then by lightly rubbing the finger-nail or a piece of ivory, bone,
or other hard substance over the upper piece of paper, a good
many of the scales may be removed. This process may be repeated
until almost all of them have been taken off. This method is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[ 20]</a></span>
efficient in the case of many of the small species when they are
still fresh; in the case of the larger species the scales may be removed
by means of a camel's-hair pencil such as is used by painters.
The chemical method of bleaching wings is simple and inexpensive.
For this purpose the wing should be dipped in alcohol
and then placed in a vessel containing a bleaching solution of some
sort. The best agent is a solution of chloride of lime. After the
color has been removed from the wing by the action of the
chloride it should be washed in a weak solution of hydrochloric
acid. It may then be cleansed in pure water and mounted upon
a piece of glass, as microscopic slides are mounted, and thus preserved.
When thus bleached the wing is capable of being minutely
studied, and all points of its anatomy are brought clearly
into view.</p>

</div>

<p>The veins in both the fore and hind wings of butterflies
may be divided into simple and
compound veins. In the fore
wing the simple veins are the
costal, the radial, and the submedian;
in the hind wing, the costal,
the subcostal, the upper and
lower radial, the submedian, and
the internal are simple. The
costal vein in the hind wing is, however, generally provided near
the base with a short ascending branch which is known as the
precostal vein. In addition to these simple veins there are in the
fore wing two branching veins, one immediately following the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[ 21]</a></span>
costal, known as the subcostal, and the other preceding the submedian,
known as the median vein. The branches of these compound
veins are known as nervules. The median vein always
has three nervules. The nervules of the subcostal veins branch
upwardly and outwardly toward the costal margin and the apex
of the fore wing. There are always from four to five subcostal
nervules. In the hind wing the subcostal is simple. The median
vein in the hind wing has three nervules as in the fore wing. Between
the subcostal and the median veins, toward the base in both
wings, is inclosed the cell, which may be wholly or partially open
at its outer extremity, or closed. The veinlets which close the cell
at its outward extremity are known
as the discocellular veins, of which
there are normally three. From the
point of union of these discocellular
veins go forth the radial veins known
respectively as the upper and lower
radials, though the upper radial in
many genera is emitted from the
lower margin of the subcostal.</p>

<p>An understanding of these terms
is, however, more readily derived
from a study of the figure in which
the names of these parts are indicated
(Fig. 40).</p>

<p>Butterflies generally hold their
wings erect when they are at rest,
with their two upper surfaces in
proximity, the under surfaces alone
displaying their colors to the eye.
Only in a few genera of the larger
butterflies, and these tropical species,
with which this book does not deal,
is there an exception to this rule,
save in the case of the <i>Hesperiid&aelig;</i>, or "skippers," in which very
frequently, while the anterior wings are folded together, the
posterior wings lie in a horizontal position.</p>

<p><i>Internal Organs.</i>&mdash;Thus far we have considered only the external
organs of the butterfly. The internal organs have been
made the subject of close study and research by many writers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[ 22]</a></span>
and a volume might be prepared upon this subject. It will, however,
suffice for us to call the attention of the student to the principal
facts.</p>

</div>

<p>The muscular system finds its principal development in the
thorax, which bears the organs of locomotion. The digestive system
consists of the proboscis,
which has already been described,
the gullet, or &oelig;sophagus,
and the stomach, over
which is a large, bladder-like
vessel called the food-reservoir,
a sort of crop preceding
the true stomach, which is a
cylindrical tube; the intestine
is a slender tube, varying in
shape in different genera, divided
into the small intestine,
the colon, and the rectum.
Butterflies breathe through
spiracles, little oval openings
on the sides of the segments
of the body, branching from
which inwardly are the trache&aelig;,
or bronchial tubes.
The heart, which is located in
the same relative position as
the spine in vertebrate animals,
is a tubular structure.
The nervous system lies on
the lower or ventral side of
the body, its position being
exactly the reverse of that
which is found in the higher
animals. It consists of nervous
cords and ganglia, or
nerve-knots, in the different
segments. Those in the head
are more largely developed than elsewhere, forming a rudimentary
brain, the larger portion of which consists of two enormous
optic nerves. The student who is desirous of informing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[ 23]</a></span>
himself more thoroughly and accurately as to the internal anatomy
of these insects may consult with profit some of the treatises
which are mentioned in the list of works dealing with the subject
which is given elsewhere in this book.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Polymorphism and Dimorphism.</i>&mdash;Species of butterflies often
show great differences in the different broods which appear. The
brood which emerges in the springtime from the chrysalis, which
has passed the winter
under the snows, may
differ very strikingly
from the insect which
appears in the second or
summer brood; and the
insects of the third or
fall brood may differ
again from either the
spring or the summer
brood. The careful student
notes these differences.
Such species are
called polymorphic, that
is, appearing under different
forms. Some species
reveal a singular
difference between the
sexes, and there may be
two forms of the same
sex in the same species.
This is most common in
the case of the female
butterfly, and where
there are two forms of
the female or the male
such a species is said to
have dimorphic females
or males. This phenomenon is revealed in the case of the
well-known Turnus Butterfly; in the colder regions of the
continent the females are yellow banded with black, like the
males, but in more southern portions of the continent black
females are quite common, and these dark females were once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[ 24]</a></span>
thought, before the truth was known, to constitute a separate
species.</p>

<p><i>Albinism and Melanism.</i>&mdash;Albinos, white or light-colored
forms, are quite common among butterflies, principally among
the females. On the other hand, melanism, or a tendency to the
production of dark or even black forms, reveals itself. Melanism
is rather more common in the case of the male sex than in
the female sex. The collector and student will always endeavor,
if possible, to preserve these curious <i>aberrations</i>, as they are
called. We do not yet entirely understand what are the causes
which are at work to produce these changes in the color, and all
such aberrant specimens have interest for the scientific man.</p>

<p><i>Monstrosities.</i>&mdash;Curious malformations, producing monstrosities,
sometimes occur among insects, as in other animals, and
such malformed specimens should likewise be preserved when
found. One form of malformation which is not altogether uncommon
consists in an apparent confusion of sexes in specimens,
the wings of a male insect being attached to the body of a female,
or half of an insect being male and half female.</p>

<p><i>Mimicry.</i>&mdash;One of the most singular and interesting facts in
the animal kingdom is what has been styled mimicry. Certain
colors and forms are possessed by animals which adapt them to
their surroundings in such wise that they are in a greater or less
degree secured from observation and attack. Or they possess
forms and colors which cause them to approximate in appearance
other creatures, which for some reason are feared or disliked
by animals which might prey upon them, and in consequence of
this resemblance enjoy partial or entire immunity. Some butterflies,
for instance, resemble dried leaves, and as they are seated
upon the twigs of trees they wholly elude the eye. This illustrates
the first form of mimicry. Other butterflies so closely approximate
in form and color species which birds and other insects will
not attack, because of the disagreeable juices which their bodies
contain, that they are shunned by their natural enemies, in spite
of the fact that they belong to groups of insects which are
ordinarily greedily devoured by birds and other animals. A
good illustration of this fact is found in the case of the Disippus
Butterfly, which belongs to a group which is not specially protected,
but is often the prey of insect-eating creatures. This
butterfly has assumed almost the exact color and markings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[ 25]</a></span>
milkweed butterfly, <i>Anosia plexippus</i>, which is distasteful to
birds, and hence enjoys peculiar freedom from the attacks of
enemies. Because this adaptation of one form to another evidently
serves the purpose of defense this phenomenon has been
called "protective mimicry." The reader who is curious to know
more about the subject will do well to consult the writings of
Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace and Mr. Darwin, who have written at
length upon mimicry among butterflies. There is here a field of
most interesting inquiry for the student.</p>

<p><i>The Distribution of Butterflies.</i>&mdash;Butterflies are found everywhere
that plant life suited to the nourishment of the caterpillars
is found. There are some species which are arctic and are found
in the brief summer of the cold North and upon the lofty summits
of high mountains which have an arctic climate. Most of them
are, however, children of the sun, and chiefly abound in the temperate
and tropical regions of the earth. While the number of
species which are found in the tropics vastly exceeds the number
of species found in the temperate zone, it is apparently true that
the number of specimens of certain species is far more numerous
in temperate regions than in the tropics. Very rarely in tropical
countries are great assemblages of butterflies to be seen, such as
may be found in the summer months in the United States, swarming
around damp places, or hovering over the fields of blooming
clover or weeds. In the whole vast region extending from the
Rio Grande of Texas to the arctic circle it is doubtful whether
more than seven hundred species of butterflies are found. On
the continent of Europe there are only about four hundred and
fifty species. The number of species of butterflies and the number
of species of birds in the United States are very nearly the
same.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>COLLECTING APPARATUS</b></p>

<p><i>Nets.</i>&mdash;In the capture of insects of all orders, and especially of
butterflies and moths, one of the most important instruments is
the net. German naturalists make use of what are known as
shears (<i>Scheren</i>), which are made like gigantic scissors, having at
the end two large oval rings upon which wire gauze or fine netting
is stretched. With this implement, which looks like an old-fashioned
candle-snuffer of colossal size, they succeed in collecting
specimens without doing much injury. Shears are, however,
not much in vogue among the naturalists of other countries. The
favorite instrument for the ordinary collector is the net. Nets may
be made in various ways and of various materials. There are a
multitude of devices which have been invented for enabling the
net to be folded up so as to occupy but little space when not
in use. The simplest form of the net, which can be made
almost anywhere, is constructed as follows: A rod&mdash;preferably
of bamboo, or some other light, stiff material&mdash;is used as the
handle, not more than five feet in length. Attached to this at its
upper end, a loop or ring made of metal, or some moderately stiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[ 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="noin">yet flexible material, should be tied securely. Upon this there
should be sewed a bag of fine netting, preferably tarletan. The
bag should be quite long, not less than eighteen inches deep;
the ring should be not less than a foot in diameter.
Such a net can be made at a cost of but a few
cents, and will be, in most cases, as efficient as
any of the more
expensive nets
which are more
carefully constructed.
A good,
cheap ring for a
net may be made
by using the brass
ferrule of a fishing-rod.
The
ferrule should be
at least three quarters of an inch in diameter. Into this insert the
ends of a metal ring made by bending brass, aluminium, or iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[ 28]</a></span>
wire into the proper form. When the ends have been inserted
into the ferrule, melted solder or lead may be poured into it, and
the ends of the wire forming the ring will be thus firmly secured
in the ferrule. The ferrule can then be inserted into its mate
placed at the end of a bamboo rod. I have commonly obtained
for this purpose the last joint or butt of a fishing-rod as
the handle of a net. Such a handle can often be purchased
for a small sum from a dealer in fishing-rods. It can be made
very cheaply. Any kind of a stick, if not too heavy, will do. It is
sometimes convenient to have it in your power to lengthen the
handle of your net so as to reach objects that are at some elevation
above the head, and for this purpose I have had nets made with
handles capable of being lengthened by jointed extensions. In
collecting in tropical countries, among tall shrubbery and undergrowth,
nets thus made, capable of having their handles greatly
lengthened, have often proved serviceable. One of the most
successful collectors I have ever had in my employment made
his net by simply bending a piece of bamboo into the form
of the frame of an Indian snow-shoe, to which he attached a
handle about a foot and a half in length, and to this he affixed
a bag of netting. He was, however, a Japanese, and possessed a
singular dexterity in the capture of specimens with this simple
apparatus to which I myself never attained. When tarletan cannot
be had, ordinary mosquito-netting will do as the material for
the bag. It is, however, too coarse in the mesh for many delicate
and minute species. Very fine netting for the manufacture of the
bags is made in Switzerland, and can be obtained from reputable
dealers.</p>

<p>In order to protect and preserve the net, it is well to bind it
with some thin muslin at the point where it is joined to the ring.
Nets are sometimes made with a strip of muslin, about two inches
wide, attached to the entire circumference of the ring, and to this
strip of muslin the bag is sewed. For my part, I prefer gray or
green as the color for a net. White should be avoided, as experience
shows that a white net will often alarm an insect when
a net of darker material will not cause it to fly before the collector
is ready to bring the net down over the spot where it is settled.</p>

<p><i>Collecting-Jars.</i>&mdash;In killing insects various methods have been
used. In practice the most approved method is to employ a jar
charged with cyanide of potash or with carbonate of ammonia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[ 29]</a></span>
For large moths and butterflies cyanide of potash and carbonate
of ammonia serve very well, but it must be remembered that
carbonate of ammonia bleaches insects which are green in color.
It is well, in my judgment, to use a drop or two of chloroform in
the jar charged with carbonate of ammonia, for the collection of
diurnal lepidoptera. By putting a few drops of chloroform into
the jar, the insect is anesthetized, and its struggles are made
quickly to cease. The principal objection to chloroform is the
fact that it induces rigidity of the thoracic muscles,
which subsequently sometimes interferes with
handsome setting.</p>

</div>

<p>In the preparation of the poisoning-jar it is
well to use a jar which has a ground-glass stopper,
and the mouth of which is about three inches
in diameter. This will be large enough for most
specimens. The one-pound hydrate of chloral jars,
provided with glass stoppers and sold by Schering,
make the neatest collecting-jars that are known to
the writer. I have found it well to have such jars
partly covered with leather after the fashion of a
drinking-flask. An opening in the leather is left
on either side, permitting an inspection of the
contents of the jar. The leather protects from
breakage. At the bottom of such a jar a few lumps of cyanide
of potash, about the size of a filbert, should be placed. Over
this may be laid a little cotton, to prevent the lumps from rattling
about loosely at the bottom of the jar. Over the cotton
there is pasted a sheet of strong white paper,
perforated with a multitude of holes. In securing
the white paper over the cyanide, the writer has
resorted to a simple method which is explained
in the annexed diagram. A piece of paper is
placed under the jar, and a circle the size of the
inside of the jar is traced upon it. Then a disk
is cut out about three quarters of an inch greater
in diameter than the original circle (Fig. 47). The
paper is punctured over the entire surface included
within the inner line, and then, with a scissors, little gashes are
made from the outer circumference inward, so as to permit of
the folding up of the edge of the disk. A little gum tragacanth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[ 30]</a></span>
then applied to these upturned edges; and it is inserted into the
jar and pasted securely over the cyanide by the upturned flaps.
A jar thus charged will last for a long time, if kept properly closed
when not in use. Cyanide of potash has a tendency to deliquesce,
or melt down in the presence of moisture, and in very humid climates
or damp places, if the jar is not kept well stoppered, the
cyanide will quickly become semi-fluid, the paper will become
moist, and specimens placed in the jar will be injured or completely
ruined. It is well, however, to bear in mind the fact that
the fumes of hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid), which are active in
producing the death of the insect, will not be given off in sufficient
volume unless there is some small amount of moisture present
in the jar; and in a very dry climate the writer has found it
sometimes necessary to add a drop or two of water from time to
time to the cyanide. The same method which has been described
for charging a jar with cyanide of potash can be employed in
charging it with carbonate of ammonia.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 48.</a>&mdash;Method of disabling a butterfly by pinching
it when in the net.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Field-Boxes.</i>&mdash;In collecting butterflies it is often possible to
kill, or half kill, the specimens contained in the net by a smart
pinch administered to the insect by the thumb and the first finger,
the pressure being applied from without the net (Fig. 48). This
mode of procedure, however, unless the operator is careful, is apt
to somewhat damage the specimens. The writer prefers to hold
the insect firmly between the thumb and the first finger, and apply
a drop or two of chloroform from a vial which should be carried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[ 31]</a></span>
the upper left-hand vest-pocket. The application of the chloroform
will cause the insect to cease its struggles immediately, and
it may then be placed in the poisoning-jar, or it may be pinned
into the field-box. The field-box, which should be worn at the
side, securely held in its place by a strap going over the shoulder
and by another strap around the waist, may be provided with the
poisoning apparatus or may be without it. In the former case the
box should be of tin, and should have securely fastened in one corner
some lumps of cyanide, tied in gauze. The box should be very
tight, so that when it is closed the fumes of the cyanide may be
retained. The bottom should be covered with cork, upon which
the specimens, as they are withdrawn from the poisoning-jar,
should be pinned. It is well to bear strictly in mind that it is a
mistake to continue to put one specimen after another into the
poisoning-jar until it is half filled or quite filled with specimens.
In walking about the field, if there are several insects in the jar at
a time, they are likely to become rubbed and their beauty partially
destroyed by being tossed about as the collector moves from place
to place; and a large insect placed in a jar in which there are one
or two smaller insects will in its death-struggles possibly injure the
latter. So, as fast as the insects are partially asphyxiated, or deprived
of the power of motion, they should be removed from the
poisoning-jar to the poisoning-box, where they are pinned in place
and prevented from rubbing one against the other. Some collectors
prefer simply to stun the insects, and then pin them into the
field-box, where they are left, in whole or in part, to recover their
vitality, to be subsequently put to death upon the return of the
collector from the field. This mode of procedure, while undoubtedly
it yields in the hands of a skilful operator the most beautiful
specimens, appears to the writer to be somewhat cruel, and he
does not therefore approve of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV.</a></span></div>

<p><i>The Use of the Net.</i>&mdash;In the use of the net the old saying is
true that "practice makes perfect." The bag of the net should be
sufficiently long to allow of its being completely closed when
hanging from the ring on either side. It is possible to sweep
into the net an insect which is fluttering through the air, and then
by a turn of the hand to close the bag and to capture the specimen.
When the insect has alighted upon the ground it is best
to clap the net over it and then to raise the net with one hand.
Very many species have the habit of flying upward. This is par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[ 32]</a></span>ticularly
true of the skippers, a group of very vigorous and swift-flying
butterflies. The writer prefers, if possible, to clap the net
over the specimens and then to allow them to rise, and, by inserting
the wide-mouthed collecting-jar below, to capture them without
touching them at all with the fingers. So far as possible the
fingers should not be allowed to come in contact with specimens,
whether in or out of the net, though some persons acquire an extremely
delicate yet firm touch which enables them to handle the
wings of frail species without removing any of the scales. Nothing
is more unsightly in a collection than specimens that have
been caught and rubbed by the fingers.</p>

<p><i>Baits.</i>&mdash;Moths are frequently taken by the method of collecting
known as "sugaring." But it may also be employed for butterflies.
For this purpose a mixture of beer and cheap brown sugar
may be used. If the beer be stale drippings, so much the better.
In fact, it is well, if the collector intends to remain in one locality
for some time, to make a mixture of beer and sugar some hours
or a day in advance of its application. In semi-tropical countries
a mixture of beer and sugar is hardly as good as a mixture of
molasses and water into which a few tablespoonfuls of Jamaica
rum have been put. A mixture thus prepared seems to attract
more effectually than the first prescription. Having provided a
pail with a quart or two of the mixture, the collector resorts to the
point where he proposes to carry on his work. With an ordinary
whitewash brush the mixture is applied to the trunks of trees,
stumps, fence-rails, and other objects. It is well to apply the
mixture to a series of trees and posts located on the side of a bit
of woodland, or along a path through forests, if comparatively
open and not too dense. The writer has rarely had success in
sugaring in the depths of forests. His greatest success has always
been on paths and at the edge of woods. Many beetles
and other insects come to the tempting sweets, and separate jars
for capturing these should be carried in the pocket. The collector
never should attempt to kill beetles in the same jar into which he
is putting butterflies. The hard, horny bodies and spiny legs of
beetles will make sad havoc with the delicate wings of butterflies.</p>

<p>Many other baits besides this may be employed to attract insects.
Some writers recommend a bait prepared by boiling dried
apples and mashing them into a pulp, adding a little rum to the
mixture, and applying this to the bark of trees. In tropical coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[ 33]</a></span>tries
bananas, especially rotten bananas, seem to have a charm for
insects. The cane-trash at sugar-mills is very attractive. If possible,
it is well to obtain a quantity of this trash and scatter it
along forest paths. Some insects have very peculiar appetites and
are attracted by things loathsome. The ordure of carnivorous
animals seems to have a special charm for some of the most magnificently
colored and the rarest of tropical butterflies. A friend of
mine in Africa, who collected for me for a number of years, used
to keep civet-cats, the ordure of which was collected and placed
at appropriate points in the forest paths; and he was richly rewarded
by obtaining many insects which were not obtained in
any other way. Putrid fish have a charm for other species, and
dead snakes, when rankly high, will attract still others. It may
be observed that after the trees have been treated for a succession
of days or nights with the sweetening mixture spoken of above,
they become very productive. When collecting in Japan I
made it a rule to return in the morning to the spots that I had
sugared for moths the evening before, and I was always amply
repaid by finding multitudes of butterflies and even a good many
day-flying moths seated upon the mossy bark, feasting upon the
remnants of the banquet I had provided the evening before. There
is no sport&mdash;I do not except that of the angler&mdash;which is more
fascinating than the sport derived by an enthusiastic entomologist
from the practice of "sugaring." It is well, however, to know
always where your path leads, and not to lay it out in the dusk, as
the writer once did when staying at a well-known summer resort
in Virginia. The path which he had chosen as the scene of
operations was unfortunately laid, all unknown to himself, just
in the rear of the poultry-house of a man who sold chickens to
the hotel; and when he saw the dark lantern mysteriously moving
about, he concluded that some one with designs upon his hens
was hidden in the woods, and opened fire with a seven-shooter,
thus coming very near to terminating abruptly the career of an
ardent entomologist.</p>

<p><i>Beating.</i>&mdash;There are many species which are apparently not
attracted by baits such as we have spoken of in the preceding
paragraph. The collector, passing through the grove, searches
diligently with his eye and captures what he can see, but does
not fail also with the end of his net-handle to tap the trunks of
trees and to shake the bushes, and as the insects fly out, to note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[ 34]</a></span>
the point where they settle, and then make them his prey. It
is well in this work, as in all collecting, to proceed somewhat
leisurely, and to keep perfectly cool. The caricature sometimes
found in newspapers of the ardent lepidopterist running like a
"quarter-back" across a ten-acre lot in quest of some flying insect
does not represent the truly skilful collector, whose movements
are more or less stealthy and cautious.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>THE BREEDING OF SPECIMENS</b></p>

<p>By breeding it is possible to obtain specimens in the most
perfect condition. Bred specimens which have not had an opportunity
to fly are always preferred on account of their freshness of
color and perfection of form. A great many species which apparently
are exceedingly rare may often be obtained in considerable
numbers by the process of breeding, the caterpillar being
more readily found than the perfect insect. Although the process
of breeding involves a good deal of labor and care, it affords a
most delightful field for observation, and the returns are frequently
of the very greatest value.</p>

<p><i>How to Get the Eggs of Butterflies.</i>&mdash;The process of breeding
may begin with the egg. The skilful eye of the student will detect
the eggs of butterflies upon the leaves upon which they have
been deposited. The twig may be cut and placed in a vase, in
water, and kept fresh until the minute caterpillar emerges, and
then from time to time it may be transferred to fresh leaves of the
same species of plant, and it will continue to make its moults
until at last it is transformed into a chrysalis, and in due season
the butterfly emerges. Eggs may frequently be obtained in considerable
numbers by confining the female under gauze, with the
appropriate food-plant. A knowledge of the food-plant may
often be obtained by watching the female and observing upon
what plants she deposits her eggs. The exceedingly beautiful
researches of Mr. W.H. Edwards were largely promoted by his
skill in inducing females to oviposit upon their food-plants. He
did this generally by confining the female with the food-plant in
a barrel or nail-keg, the bottom of which had been knocked
out, and over the top of which he tied mosquito-netting.
The plant was placed under the keg. The insects thus con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[ 35]</a></span>fined may
be fed with a mixture of honey and water placed
upon the leaves.</p>

<p>In collecting caterpillars it is well to have on hand a number
of small boxes in which to place them, and also a botany-box in
which to bring from the field a supply of their appropriate food.</p>

<p>The process of breeding may begin with the caterpillar. The
collector, having discovered the caterpillar feeding upon the branch
of a certain plant, provides the creature with a constant supply
of the fresh foliage of the same plant, until it finally pupates.</p>

<i>G</i>, lid covered with mosquito-netting;
<i>E</i>, pan of earth; <i>B</i>, bottle for

</div>

<p><i>Breeding-Cages.</i>&mdash;Various devices for breeding caterpillars and
rearing moths and butterflies are
known. One of the most important
of these devices is the breeding-cage,
which is sometimes called
a vivarium. The simplest form
of the vivarium is often the best.
In breeding some species the best
method is simply to pot a plant
of the species upon which the larva
is known to feed, and to place
the potted plant in a box over
which some mosquito-netting is
tied. The writer frequently employs
for this purpose cylinders of
glass over the top of which perforated
cardboard is placed. This method, however, can be resorted
to only with the more minute forms and with plants that
do not attain great height. Another form of vivarium is represented
in the adjoining woodcut (Fig. 50). The writer has successfully
employed, for breeding insects upon a large scale, ordinary
store boxes provided with a lid made by fastening together
four pieces of wood, making a frame large enough to cover the top
of the box, and covering it with gauze. The food-plant is kept
fresh in bottles or jars which are set into the boxes. Be careful,
however, after you have put the branches upon which the caterpillars
are feeding into the jars, to stuff something into the neck of the
jar so as to prevent the caterpillar from accidentally getting into
the water and drowning himself&mdash;a mishap which otherwise
might occur. When breeding is undertaken on a still larger scale,
it may be well to set apart for this purpose a room, preferably in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[ 36]</a></span>
an outbuilding, all the openings leading from which should be
carefully closed so as to prevent the escape of the caterpillars.</p>

sides are of glass (Riley).</span>
</div>

<p><i>How to Find Caterpillars.</i>&mdash;Many species of caterpillars are not
hard to discover; they are more or less conspicuous objects, and
strike the eye. Some species conceal themselves by weaving
together the leaves of the plant on which they feed, or by bending
a single leaf into a curved receptacle in which they lie hidden.
Others conceal themselves during the daytime about the roots of
trees or under bark or stones, only emerging in the night-time to
feed upon the foliage. The collector will carefully search for
these. The presence of caterpillars is generally indicated by the
ravages which they have committed upon the foliage. By carefully
scanning a branch the collector will observe that the leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[ 37]</a></span>
have been more or less devoured. Generally underneath the tree
will be found the frass, or ejectamenta, of the caterpillar. The
presence of the ejectamenta and the evidence of the ravages committed
by the larv&aelig; upon the foliage will give the collector a clue
to the whereabouts of the caterpillar. The writer has found it
generally advantageous to search for caterpillars that feed upon
trees along the wide, sandy margins of brooks and rivers. The
frass is easily discovered upon the sand, and by casting the eye
upward into the foliage it is often easy to detect the insect. The
pavements in towns and cities which are bordered by trees may
also very well be scanned for evidence of the presence of caterpillars.
A favorite collecting-ground of the writer is one of the
large cemeteries of the city in which he lives, in which there are
numerous trees and a great quantity of shrubbery. Wood-boring
species, as a rule, are more difficult to obtain and rear than those
that feed upon the foliage.</p>

<p><i>Hibernating Caterpillars.</i>&mdash;While some difficulty attends the
preservation of chrysalids in the case of those species which
pupate in the fall and pass the winter in the chrysalis state under
the ground, far more difficulty attends the preservation of species
which hibernate in the caterpillar state. As a rule, it is found best
to expose the boxes containing these species in an ice-house or
other cold place, keeping them there until there is available an
abundant supply of the tender shoots of the plant upon which
they are in the habit of feeding. They may then be brought forth
from cold storage and placed in proximity to the food-plant,
upon which they will proceed to feed.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>THE PRESERVATION OF SPECIMENS</b></p>

<p><i>Papering Specimens.</i>&mdash;When time and opportunities do not
suffice for the proper preparation of butterflies for display in
the permanent collection, the collector may, in the case of the
larger species, conveniently place them in envelopes, with their
wings folded (Fig. 51), and they may then be stored in a box
until such time as he is able to relax the specimens and properly
mount them. Thousands of insects are thus annually collected.
The small drug envelopes, or the larger pay-roll envelopes,
which may be bought in boxes by the thousand of any stationer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[ 38]</a></span>
a comparatively small sum, are preferable because of their convenience.
Many collectors, however, paper their specimens in envelopes
which they make of oblong bits of paper adapted to the size
of the insect. The process of making the envelope and of papering
the insect is accurately depicted in the accompanying cut
(Fig. 52). The writer finds it good in
the case of small butterflies to place
them in boxes between layers of cheap
plush or velvet. A small box, a few
inches long, may be provided, and at
its bottom a layer of velvet is placed;
upon this a number of small butterflies
are laid. Over them is placed a layer of velvet, with its soft
pile facing the same side of the velvet at the bottom. On top
of this another piece of velvet is laid, with its pile upward,
and other specimens are again deposited, and over this another
piece of velvet is laid, and so on. If the box is not filled full at
once, it is well to have enough pieces of velvet cut to fill it, or else
place cotton on top, so as to keep the layers of velvet from moving
or shaking about. A yard or two
of plush or velvet will suffice for the
packing of a thousand specimens of
small butterflies.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Mounting Butterflies.</i>&mdash;When the
collector has time enough at his disposal
he should at once mount his
specimens as they are intended to be
displayed in the collection. We shall
now proceed to explain the manner in
which this is most advantageously accomplished.
The insect should first of all be pinned. The pin should
be thrust perpendicularly through the thorax, midway between the
wings, and at a considerable elevation upon the pin. It should
then be placed upon the setting-board or setting-block. Setting-boards
or setting-blocks are pieces of wood having a groove on
the upper surface of sufficient depth to accommodate the body of
the insect and to permit the wings to be brought to the level
of the upper surface of the board (Fig. 53). They should also be
provided either with a cleft or a hole which will permit the pin to
be thrust down below the body of the insect for a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[ 39]</a></span>
distance. As a rule, the wings of all specimens should be mounted
at a uniform elevation of about seven eighths of an inch above the
point of the pin. This is known as the "continental method" of
mounting, and is infinitely preferable
to the old-fashioned "English
method," in which the insect was
pinned low down upon the pin, so
that its wings touched the surface of
the box.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 53.</a>&mdash;Setting-board designed

insect are held in place by strips of
tracing-muslin, such as is used by
engineers. The grooves at the side
serve to hold the board in place in
the drying-box. (See Fig. 59.)</span>

</div>

<p>Setting-blocks are most advantageously
employed in setting small
species, especially the <i>Hesperiid&aelig;</i>,
the wings of which are refractory.
When the insect has been pinned
upon the setting-board or setting-block,
the next step is to set the
wings in the position which they
are to maintain when the specimen
is thoroughly dry. This is accomplished
by means of what are known as "setting-needles"
(Fig. 56). Setting-needles may be easily made by simply sticking
ordinary needles into wooden matches from which the tips
have been removed. In drawing the wings into position, care
should be taken to plant the setting-needle
behind the strong nervure on the costal
margin of the
wing; otherwise
the wings are liable
to be torn and
disfigured. The
rule in setting lepidoptera
is to draw
the anterior wing
forward in such
a manner that the
posterior margin of this wing is at right angles to the axis of
the body, the axis of the body being a line drawn through the
head to the extremity of the abdomen. The hind wing should
then be moved forward, its anterior margin lying under the opposing
margin of the front wing. When the wings have thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[ 40]</a></span>
been adjusted into the position which they are to occupy, slips
of tracing-muslin or of paper should be drawn down over them
and securely pinned, the setting-needles being removed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illo_075a.jpg" width="200" height="22" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 56.&mdash;Setting-needle.</a></span>
</div>

<p>In pinning down the
strips which are to hold the
wings in place, be careful
to pin around the wing, but
never, if possible, through it. When the wings have been adjusted
in the position in which they are to remain, the antenn&aelig;, or feelers,
should be attended to and drawn forward on the same plane as the
wings and secured in place. This may ordinarily be done by setting
pins in such a position as to hold them where they are to stay.
Then the body, if it has a tendency to sag down at the end of the
abdomen, should be raised. This may also be accomplished by
means of pins thrust beneath on either side. The figure on the
next page shows more clearly what is intended. When the
insect has been set, the board should be put aside in a place where
it will not be molested or attacked by pests, and the specimens
upon it allowed to dry. A box with shelves in it is often used
for this purpose. This box should
have a door at the front covered
with wire gauze, and the back
should also be open, covered with
gauze, so as to allow a free circulation
of air. A few balls of naphthaline
placed in it will tend to keep
away mites and other pests. The
time during which the specimen
should remain on the board until it
is dried varies with its size and the
condition of the atmosphere. Most butterflies and moths in dry
weather will be sufficiently dried to permit of their removal from
the setting-boards in a week; but large, stout-bodied moths may
require as much as two weeks, or even more time, before they are
dry enough to be taken off the boards. The process of drying
may be hastened by placing the boards in an oven, but the temperature
of the oven must be quite low. If too much heat is
applied, great injury is sure to result. Only a careful and expert
operator should resort to the use of the oven, a temperature above
120&#176;F. being sure to work mischief.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Relaxing Specimens.</i>&mdash;When butterflies or moths have been
put up in papers or mounted on pins without having their wings
expanded and set it becomes necessary, before setting them, to
relax them. This may be accomplished
in several ways.
If the specimens have been
pinned it is best to place them
on pieces of sheet-cork on a
tray of sand which has been
thoroughly moistened and
treated with a good dose of
carbolic acid. Over all a bell-glass
is put. A tight tin box
will serve the same purpose,
but a broad sheet of bibulous
paper should always be put
over the box, under the lid, before closing it, and in such a way as to
leave the edges of the paper projecting around the edges of the lid.
This is done to absorb the moisture which might settle by condensation
upon the lid and drop upon the specimens. In a bell-glass the
moisture generally trickles down the sides. Earthenware crocks
with closely fitting lids are even better than tin boxes, but they
must have paper put over them, before closing, in the same way
as is done when tin boxes are used. When specimens have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[ 42]</a></span>
preserved in papers or envelopes these should be opened a little
and laid upon damp, carbolized sand under a bell-glass or in a
closed receptacle of some kind. Papered specimens may also be
placed in their envelopes between clean towels, which have been
moistened in water to which a little carbolic acid has been added.
The towels should be wrung out quite dry before using them.
The method of placing between towels should never be used in
the case of very small and delicate species and those which are
blue or green in color. Great care must be exercised not to allow
the insects to become soaked or unduly wet. This ruins them.
They should, however, be damp enough to allow the wings and
other organs to be freely moved. When the insects have been
relaxed they may be pinned and expanded on setting-boards like
freshly caught specimens. It is well in setting the wings of relaxed
specimens, after having thrust the pin through the body, to
take a small forceps and, seizing the wings just where they join
the body, gently move them so as to open them and make their
movement easy before pinning them upon the setting-board.
The skilful manipulator in this way quickly ascertains whether
they have been sufficiently relaxed to admit of their being readily
set. If discovered to be too stiff and liable to break they must be
still further relaxed. Dried specimens which have been relaxed
and then mounted generally require only a short time to dry
again, and need rarely be kept more than twenty-four hours upon
the setting-boards.</p>

<p>The process of setting insects upon setting-blocks is exactly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[ 43]</a></span>
same as when setting-boards are used, with the simple difference
that, instead of pinning strips of paper or tracing-muslin over the
wings, the wings are held in place by threads or very narrow
tapes, which are wound around the block. When the wings are not
covered with a very deep and velvety covering of scales the threads
or tapes maybe used alone; but when the wings are thus clothed
it becomes necessary to put bits of paper or cardboard over the
wings before wrapping with the threads. Unless this is done
the marks of the threads will be left upon the wings. Some
little skill, which is easily acquired by practice, is necessary in order
to employ setting-blocks to advantage, but in the case of small
species and species which have refractory wings they are much
to be preferred to the boards.</p>

<p><i>The Preparation and Preservation of Eggs.</i>&mdash;The eggs of butterflies
may be preserved by simply putting them into tubes containing
alcohol, or they may be placed in vials containing dilute
glycerine or a solution of common salt. The vials should be kept
tightly corked and should be marked by a label written with a
lead-pencil and placed within the bottle, upon which the name
of the species and the date of collection should be noted, or a
reference made to the collector's note-book. Unless the eggs of
insects are preserved in fluid they are apt in many cases to dry up
and become distorted, because, on account of their small size, it
is impossible to void them of their contents. The larv&aelig; escaping
from eggs often void the shell very neatly, leaving, however, a
large orifice. Such remnants of shells may be preserved, as they
often are useful in showing some of the details of marking; but
great vigilance in securing them should be exercised, for almost
all the larv&aelig; of butterflies have the curious habit of whetting their
appetites for future repasts by turning around and either wholly
or partially devouring the shell of the egg which they have quitted.
Eggs are most neatly mounted in the form of microscopic slides
in glycerine jelly contained in cells of appropriate depth and diameter.
It is best, if possible, to mount several specimens upon the
same slide, showing the side of the egg as well as the end. A
cabinet filled with the eggs of butterflies thus mounted is valuable
and curious.</p>

<p><i>The Preservation of Chrysalids.</i>&mdash;Chrysalids may be deprived
of their vitality by simply immersing them in alcohol, or they
may be killed by means of chloroform, and they may then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[ 44]</a></span>
fastened upon pins like the imago, and arranged appropriately
in the collection with the species. Some chrysalids, however,
lose their color when killed in this way, and it is occasionally
well to void them of their contents by making an opening
and carefully removing the parts that are contained within, replacing
with some material which will prevent the chrysalis from
shrinking and shriveling. This method of preserving need, however,
be resorted to only in exceptional cases. When a butterfly
has escaped from its chrysalis it frequently leaves the entire shell
behind, with the parts somewhat sundered, yet, nevertheless,
furnishing a clear idea of the structure of the chrysalis. If no
other specimen of the chrysalis can be obtained than these voided
shells they should be preserved.</p>

<p><i>The Preservation of Caterpillars.</i>&mdash;The caterpillars of butterflies
when they first emerge from the egg, and before they make the
first moult, are, for the most part, extremely small, and are best
preserved as microscopic objects in cells filled with glycerine.
After each successive moult the larva increases rapidly in size.
These various stages in the development of the caterpillar should
all be noted and preserved, and it is customary to put up
these collections in vials filled with alcohol or a solution
of formaline (which latter, by the by, is preferable to alcohol),
or to inflate them. The method of inflation secures the
best specimens.</p>

<p>In inflating larv&aelig; the first step is carefully to remove the contents
of the larval skin. This may be done by making an incision
with a stout pin or a needle at the anal extremity, and then, between
the folds of a soft towel or cloth, pressing out the contents
of the abdominal cavity. The pressure should be first applied near
the point where the pellicle has been punctured, and should then
be carried forward until the region of the head is reached. Care
must be exercised to apply only enough pressure to expel the
contents of the skin without disturbing the tissues which lie
nearest to the epidermis, in which the pigments are located, and
not to remove the hairs which are attached to the body. Pressure
sufficient to bruise the skin should never be applied. A little
practice soon imparts the required dexterity. The contents of
the larval skin having been removed, the next step is to inflate
and dry the empty skin. A compact statement of the method of
performing this operation is contained in Hornaday's "Taxidermy
and Zo&ouml;logical Collecting," from the pen of the writer, and I herewith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[ 45]</a></span>

<p>"The simplest method of inflating the skins of larv&aelig; after the
contents have been withdrawn is to insert a straw or grass stem
of appropriate thickness into the opening through which the
contents have been removed, and then by the breath to inflate the
specimen, while holding over the chimney of an Argand lamp,
the flame of which must be regulated so as not to scorch or
singe it. Care must be taken in the act of inflating not to unduly
distend the larval skin, thus producing a distortion, and also to dry
it thoroughly. Unless the latter precaution is observed a subsequent
shrinking and disfigurement will take place. The process
of inflating in the manner just described is somewhat laborious,
and while some of the finest specimens which the writer has ever
seen were prepared in this primitive manner, various expedients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[ 46]</a></span>
for lessening the labor involved have been devised, some of which
are to be highly commended.</p>

</div>

<p>"A comparatively inexpensive arrangement for inflating larv&aelig;
is a modification of that described in the 'Entomologische Nachrichten'
(1879, vol. v, p. 7), devised by Mr. Fritz A. Wachtel
(Fig. 61). It consists of a foot-bellows such as is used by
chemists in the laboratory, or, better still, of a small cylinder
such as is used for holding gas in operating the oxyhydrogen
lamp of a sciopticon. In
the latter case the compressed
air should not
have a pressure exceeding
twenty pounds to the
square inch, and the cock regulating the flow from the cylinder
should be capable of very fine adjustment. By means of a rubber
tube the air is conveyed from the cylinder to a couple of flasks, one
of which contains concentrated sulphuric acid, and the other is intended
for the reception of any overflow of the hydrated sulphuric
acid which may occur. The object of passing the air through
sulphuric acid is to rob it, so far as possible, of its moisture. It
is then conveyed into a flask, which is
heated upon a sand-bath, and thence by a
piece of flexible tubing to a tip mounted
on a joint allowing vertical and horizontal
motion and secured by a standard to the
working-table. The flow of air through
the tip is regulated by a cock. Upon the
tip is fastened a small rubber tube, into the
free extremity of which is inserted a fine-pointed
glass tube. This is provided
with an armature consisting of two steel
springs fastened upon opposite sides, and their ends bent at right
angles in such a way as to hold the larval skin firmly to the
extremity of the tube. The skin having been adjusted upon
the fine point of the tube, the bellows is put into operation, and
the skin is inflated. A drying apparatus is provided in several
ways. A copper plate mounted upon four legs, and heated by an
alcohol-lamp placed below, has been advocated by some. A better
arrangement, used by the writer, consists of a small oven heated
by the flame of an alcohol-lamp or by jets of natural gas, and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[ 47]</a></span>vided
with circular openings of various sizes, into which the larval
skin is introduced (Fig. 63).</p>

<p>"A less commendable method of preserving larv&aelig; is to place
them in alcohol. The larv&aelig; should be tied up in sacks of light
gauze netting, and a label of tough paper, with the date and
locality of capture, and the name, if known, written with a lead-pencil,
should be attached to each such little sack. Do not use
ink on labels to be immersed, but a hard lead-pencil. Alcoholic
specimens are liable to become shriveled and discolored, and
are not nearly as valuable as well-inflated and dried skins.</p>

</div>

<p>"When the skins have been inflated they may be mounted
readily by being placed upon wires wrapped with green silk, or
upon annealed aluminium wire. The wires are bent and twisted
together for a short distance and then made to diverge. The
diverging ends are pressed together, a little shellac is placed upon
their tips, and they are then inserted into the opening at the anal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[ 48]</a></span>
extremity of the larval skin. Upon the release of pressure they
spread apart, and after the shellac has dried the skin is firmly
held by them. They may then be attached to pins by simply
twisting the free end of the wire about the pin, or they may be
placed upon artificial imitations of the leaves and twigs of their
appropriate food-plants."</p>


<p class="cen"><b>THE PRESERVATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF</b>
<b>COLLECTIONS</b></p>

<p>The secret of preserving collections of lepidoptera in beautiful
condition is to exclude light, moisture, and insect pests.
Light ultimately bleaches many species, moisture leads to mould
and mildew, and insect pests devour the specimens. The main
thing is therefore to have the receptacles in which the specimens
are placed dark and as nearly as possible hermetically sealed and
kept in a dry place. In order to accomplish this, various devices
have been resorted to.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Boxes.</i>&mdash;Boxes for the preservation of specimens are made with
a tongue on the edges of the bottom fitting into a groove upon the
lid, or they may be made with inside
pieces fastened around the inner edge
of the bottom and projecting so as to
catch the lid.
The accompanying
outlines show
the method of
joining different
forms of boxes
(Figs. 65-67).
The bottom of
the box should
be lined with
some substance
which will enable
the specimens to
be pinned into it securely. For this purpose sheet-cork about a
quarter of an inch thick is to be preferred to all other substances.
Ground cork pressed into layers and covered with white paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[ 49]</a></span>
is manufactured for the purpose of lining boxes. Turf compressed
into sheets about half an inch thick and covered with
paper is used by many European collectors. Sheets of aloe-pith
or of the wood of the yucca, half an inch thick, are used, and the
pith of corn-stalks (Indian corn or maize) may
also be employed, laid into the box and glued
neatly to the bottom. The corn-pith should
be cut into pieces about half an inch square
and joined together neatly, covering it with
thin white paper after the surface has been
made quite even and true. Cork is, however,
the best material, for, though more expensive
than the other things named, it has greater
power to hold the pins, and unless these are
securely fixed and held in place great damage
is sure to result. A loose specimen in a box
will work incalculable damage. Boxes should
be made of light, thoroughly seasoned wood,
and should be very tight. They are sometimes
made so that specimens may be
pinned both upon the top and the bottom, but this is not to be
commended. The depth of the box should be sufficient to admit
of the use of the longest insect-pin in use, and a depth between
top and bottom of two and a quarter inches is therefore sufficient.
Boxes are sometimes made with backs in imitation of books, and
a collection arranged in
such boxes presents an
attractive external appearance.
A very good
box is made for the
United States Department
of Agriculture and
for the Carnegie Museum
in Pittsburgh (Fig.
68). This box is thirteen
inches long, nine
inches wide, and three inches thick (external measurement). The
depth between the bottom and the lid on the inside is two and
one eighth inches. The ends and sides are dovetailed; the top
and bottom are each made of two pieces of light stuff, about one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[ 50]</a></span>
eighth of an inch thick, glued together in such a way that the
grain of the two pieces crosses at right angles, and all cracking
and warping are thus prevented. The lids are secured to
the bottoms by brass hooks fitting into eyelets. Such boxes
provided with cork do not cost more than fifty-five cents apiece
when bought in quantities. Boxes may be made of stout pasteboard
about one eighth or three sixteenths of an inch thick, with
a rabbet-tongue on the inside. Such boxes are much used in
France and England, and when well and substantially made are
most excellent. They may be obtained for about thirty-five cents
apiece lined with compressed cork.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Cabinets and Drawers.</i>&mdash;Large collections which are intended
to be frequently consulted are best preserved in cabinets fitted
with glass-covered drawers. A great deal of variety exists in the
plans which are adopted for the display of specimens in cabinets.
Much depends upon the taste and the financial ability of the collector.
Large sums of money may be expended upon cabinets,
but the main thing is to secure the specimens from dust, mould,
and insect pests. The point to be observed most carefully is so
to arrange the drawers that they are, like the boxes, practically
air-tight. The writer employs as the standard size for the drawers
in his own collection and in the Carnegie Museum a drawer
which is twenty-two inches long, sixteen inches wide, and two
inches deep (inside measurement). The outside dimensions are:
length, twenty-three inches exclusive of face; breadth, seventeen
inches; height, two and three eighths inches. The covers are glazed
with double-strength glass. They are held upon the bottoms by a
rabbet placed inside of the bottom and nearly reaching the lower
surface of the glass on the cover when closed. The drawers are
lined upon the bottom with cork five sixteenths of an inch thick,
and are papered on the bottom and sides with good linen paper,
which does not easily become discolored. Each drawer is faced
with cherry and has a knob. These drawers are arranged in
cabinets built in sections for convenience in handling. The two
lower sections each contain thirty drawers, the upper section nine.
The drawers are arranged in three perpendicular series and are
made interchangeable, so that any drawer will fit into any place in
any one of the cabinets. This is very necessary, as it admits of
the easy rearrangement of collections. On the sides of each drawer
a pocket is cut on the inner surface, which communicates through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[ 51]</a></span>
an opening in the rabbet with the interior. The paper lining the
inside is perforated over this opening with a number of small
holes. The pocket is kept filled with naphthaline crystals, the
fumes of which pass into the interior and tend to keep away pests.
The accompanying figure gives the details of construction (Fig.
69). Such drawers can be made at a cost of about $3.50 apiece,
and the cost of a cabinet finished and supplied with them is about
$325, made of cherry, finished in imitation of mahogany.</p>

</div>

<p>Some persons prefer to have the bottoms as well as the tops of
the drawers in their cabinets made of glass. In such cases the
specimens are pinned upon narrow strips of wood covered with
cork, securely fastened across the inside of the drawers. This
arrangement enables the under side of specimens to be examined
and compared with as much freedom as the upper side, and without
removing them from the drawers; but the strips are liable at
times to become loosened, and when this happens great havoc is
wrought among the specimens if the drawer is moved carelessly.
Besides, there is more danger of breakage.</p>

<p>Another way of providing a cheap and very sightly lining for
the bottom of an insect-box is illustrated in Fig. 70. A frame
of wood like a slate-frame is provided, and on both sides paper is
stretched. To stretch the paper it ought to be soaked in water
before pasting to the frame; then when it dries it is as tight and
smooth as a drum-head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[ 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The beginner who has not a long purse will do well to preserve
his collections in boxes such as have been described. They can
be obtained quite cheaply and
are most excellent. Cabinets
are more or less of a luxury for
the amateur, and are only a necessity
in the case of great collections
which are constantly
being consulted. The boxes
may be arranged upon shelves.
Some of the largest and best
collections in the world are preserved
in boxes, notably those
of the United States National
Museum.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Labeling.</i>&mdash;Each specimen
should have on the pin below the specimen a small label giving
the date of capture, if known, and the locality. Below this should
be a label of larger size, giving its scientific
name, if ascertained, and the
sex. Labels should be neat and uniform
in size. A good size for labels
for large species is about one inch
long and five eighths of an inch wide.
The labels should be written in a fine
but legible hand. Smaller labels may
be used for smaller species. A crow-quill
pen and India ink are to be preferred
in writing labels.</p>

<p><i>Arrangement of Specimens.</i>&mdash;Specimens
are best arranged in rows.
The males should be pinned in first
in the series, after them the females.
Varieties should follow the species.
After these should be placed any
aberrations or monstrosities which
the collector may possess. The name
of the genus should precede all the species contained in the collection,
and after each species the specific name should be placed
<b>Fig. 71</b> shows the manner of arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Insect Pests.</i>&mdash;In order to preserve collections, great care must
be taken to exclude the various forms of insect pests, which are
likely, unless destroyed and kept from attacking the specimens,
to ruin them utterly in comparatively a short time. The pests
which are most to be feared are beetles belonging to the genera
<i>Dermestes</i> and <i>Anthrenus</i>. In addition to these beetles,
which commit their ravages in the larval stage, moths and mites
prey upon collections. Moths are very infrequently, however,
found in collections of insects, and in a long experience the writer
has known only one or two instances in which any damage was
inflicted upon specimens by the larv&aelig; of moths. Mites are much
more to be dreaded.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 72.</a>&mdash;Naphthaline
cone.</span>
</div>

<p>In order to prevent the ravages of insects, all specimens, before
putting them away into the boxes or drawers of the cabinet in
which they are to be preserved, should be placed in a tight box in
which chloroform, or, better, carbon bisulphide, in a small pan is
put, and they should be left here for at least twenty-four hours,
until it is certain that all life is extinct. Then they should be transferred
to the tight boxes or drawers in which they are to be kept.
The presence of insect pests in a collection is generally first indicated
by fine dust under the specimen, this dust being the excrement
of the larva which is committing depredations upon the
specimen. In case the presence of the larva is detected, a liberal
dose of chloroform should at once be administered to the box or
tray in which the specimen is contained. The specimen itself
ought to be removed, and may be dipped into benzine.
Naphthaline crystals or camphor is generally employed
to keep out insect pests from boxes. They are very
useful to deter the entrance of pests, but when they
have once been introduced into a collection neither naphthaline
nor camphor will kill them. Naphthaline is
prepared in the form of cones attached to a pin, and
these cones may be placed in one corner of the box.
They are made by Blake &amp; Co. of Philadelphia, and are
in vogue among entomologists. However, a good
substitute for the cones may very easily be made by
taking the ordinary moth-balls which are sold everywhere.
By heating a pin red-hot in the flame of an
alcohol-lamp it may be thrust into the moth-ball; as it enters it
melts the naphthaline, which immediately afterward cools and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[ 54]</a></span>
holds the pin securely fixed in the moth-ball. In attaching these
pins to moth-balls, hold the pin securely in a forceps while heating
it in the flame of the lamp, and thrust the red-hot pin into the
center of the ball. Naphthaline crystals and camphor may be secured
in the corner of the box by tying up a quantity of them in
a small piece of netting and pinning the little bag thus made in the
corner of the tray. By following these directions insect pests may
be kept out of collections. It is proper to observe that while carbon
bisulphide is more useful even than chloroform in killing
pests, and is also cheaper, it should be used with great care, because
when mixed with atmospheric air it is highly explosive,
and its use should never take place where there are lamps burning
or where there is fire. Besides, its odor is extremely unpleasant,
unless it has been washed in mercury.</p>

<p><i>Greasy Specimens.</i>&mdash;Specimens occasionally become greasy.
When this happens they may be cleansed by pinning them down
on a piece of cork secured to the bottom of a closed vessel, and
gently filling it with benzine, refined gasoline, or ether. After
leaving them long enough to remove all the grease they may be
taken out of the bath and allowed to dry in a place where there
is no dust. This operation should not take place near a lighted
lamp or a fire.</p>

<p><i>Mould.</i>&mdash;When specimens have become mouldy or mildewed
it is best to burn them up if they can be spared. If not, after
they have been thoroughly dried remove the mould with a sable
or camel's-hair pencil which has been rubbed in carbolic acid (crystals
liquefied by heat). Mildew in a cabinet is hard to eradicate,
and heat, even to burning, is about the only cure, except the
mild use of carbolic acid in the way suggested.</p>

<p><i>Repairing Specimens.</i>&mdash;Torn and ragged specimens are to be
preferred to none at all. "The half of a loaf is better than no
bread." Until the torn specimen can be replaced by a better, it
is always well to retain it in a collection. But it is sometimes
possible to repair torn specimens in such a way as to make them
more presentable. If an antenna, for instance, has been broken
off, it may be replaced neatly, so that only a microscopic examination
will disclose the fact that it was once away from the place
where it belonged. If a wing has been slit, the rent may be
mended so neatly that only a very careful observer can detect the
fact. If a piece has been torn out of a wing, it may be replaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[ 55]</a></span>
by the corresponding portion of the wing of another specimen of
the same sex of the same species in such a way as almost to defy
detection. The prime requisites for this work are patience, a
steady hand, a good eye, a great deal of "gumption," a few setting-needles,
a jeweler's forceps, and a little shellac dissolved in
alcohol. The shellac used in replacing a missing antenna should
be of a thickish consistency; in repairing wings it should be well
thinned down with alcohol. In handling broken antenn&aelig; it is
best to use a fine sable pencil, which may be moistened very
lightly by applying it to the tip of the tongue. With this it is
possible to pick up a loose antenna and place it wherever it is desired.
Apply the shellac to the torn edges of a broken wing with
great delicacy of touch and in very small quantity. Avoid putting
on the adhesive material in "gobs and slathers." Repairing
is a fine art, which is only learned after some patient experimentation,
and is only to be practised when absolutely necessary.
The habit of some dealers of patching up broken specimens with
parts taken from other species is highly to be reprobated. Such
specimens are more or less caricatures of the real thing, and no
truly scientific man will admit such scarecrows into his collection,
except under dire compulsion.</p>

one another, or

</div>

<p><i>Packing and Forwarding Specimens.</i>&mdash;It often becomes necessary
to forward specimens from one place to another. If it is intended
to ship specimens which have been mounted upon pins
they should be securely pinned in a box lined with cork. A great
many expanded specimens may be pinned
in a box by resorting to the method known
as "shingling," which is illustrated in Fig. 73.
By causing the wings of specimens to overlap,
as is shown in the figure, a great many
can be accommodated in a small space.
When the specimens have been packed the
box should be securely closed, its edges shut
with paper, after some drops of chloroform
have been poured into the box, and then this
box should be placed in an outer box containing
excelsior, hay, cotton, or loose shavings
in sufficient abundance to prevent the
jarring of the inner box and consequent breakage. Where specimens
are forwarded in envelopes, having been collected in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[ 56]</a></span>
field, and are not pinned, the precaution of surrounding them
with packing such as has been described is not necessary, but the
box in which they are shipped should always be strong enough
to resist breakage. Things forwarded by mail or by express
always receive rough treatment, and the writer has lost many fine
specimens which have been forwarded to him because the
shipper was careless in packing.</p>

<p><i>Pins.</i>&mdash;In the preceding pages frequent reference has been made
to insect-pins. These are pins which are made longer and thinner
than is the case with ordinary pins, and are therefore adaptable to
the special use to which they are put. There are a number of
makers whose pins have come into vogue. What are known as
Karlsbader and Kl&auml;ger pins, made in Germany, are the most widely
used. They are made of ordinary pin-metal in various sizes. The
Karlsbader pins have very fine points, but, owing to the fineness
of the points and the softness of the metal, they are very apt to
buckle, or turn up at the points. The Kl&auml;ger pins are not exposed
to the same objection, as the points are not quite so fine. The best
pins, however, which are now made are those which have recently
been introduced by Messrs. Kirby, Beard, &amp; Co. of England.
They are made of soft steel, lacquered, possessing very great
strength and considerable flexibility. The finest-sized pin of this
make has as much strength as the largest pin of the other makes
that have been mentioned, and the writer has never known them
to buckle at the tip, even when pinned through the hardest insect
tissues. While these pins are a little more expensive than others,
the writer does not fail to give them an unqualified preference.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Forceps.</i>&mdash;An instrument which is almost indispensable to
the student of entomology is the forceps. There are many forms
of forceps, and it is not necessary to speak at length in reference
to the various shapes; but for the use of the student of butterflies
the forceps made by the firm of Blake &amp; Co. of Phila<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[ 57]</a></span>delphia is to be
preferred to all others. The head of this firm is
himself a famous entomologist, and he has given us in the forceps
which is illustrated in Fig. 74 an instrument which comes as
near perfection as the art of the maker of instruments can produce.
The small forceps represented in Fig. 75 is very useful
in pinning small specimens. In handling mounted specimens it
is well always to take hold of the pin below the specimen with
the forceps, and insert it into the cork by the pressure of the forceps.
If the attempt is made to pin down a specimen with the
naked fingers holding the pin by the head, the finger is apt to
slip and the specimen to be ruined.</p>

<p>At the base of all truly scientific knowledge lies the principle
of order. There have been some who have gone so far as to say
that science is merely the orderly arrangement of facts. While
such a definition is defective, it is nevertheless true that no real
knowledge of any branch of science is attained until its relationship
to other branches of human knowledge is learned, and until
a classification of the facts of which it treats has been made.
When a science treats of things, it is necessary that these things
should become the subject of investigation, until at last their relation
to one another, and the whole class of things to which they
belong, has been discovered. Men who devote themselves to
the discovery of the relation of things and to their orderly classification
are known as systematists.</p>

<p>The great leader in this work was the immortal Linn&aelig;us, the
"Father of Natural History," as he has been called. Upon the
foundation laid by him in his work entitled "Systema Natur&aelig;,"
or "The System of Nature," all who have followed after him have
labored, and the result has been the rise of the great modern sciences
of botany and zo&ouml;logy, which treat respectively of the
vegetable and animal kingdoms.</p>

<p><i>The Place of Butterflies in the Animal Kingdom.</i>&mdash;The animal
kingdom, for purposes of classification, has been subdivided into
various groups known as subkingdoms. One of these subkingdoms
contains those animals which, being without vertebr&aelig;, or
an internal skeleton, have an external skeleton, composed of a
series of horny rings, attached to which are various organs. This
subkingdom is known by naturalists under the name of the <i>Arthropoda.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[ 59]</a></span>
The word <i>Arthropoda</i> is derived from the Greek language
and is compounded of two words, (<i>&#945;&#961;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#957;</i>), meaning a <i>joint</i>
and (<i>&#960;&#959;&#965;&#963;</i>), meaning a <i>foot</i>. The <i>Arthropoda</i> seem at first
sight to be made up of jointed rings and feet; hence the name.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a></span></div>

<p>The subkingdom of the <i>Arthropoda</i> is again subdivided into
six classes. These are the following:</p>

<p>Class I. The <i>Crustacea</i> (Shrimps, Crabs, Water-fleas, etc.).</p>

<p>Class II. The <i>Podostomata</i> (King-crabs, Trilobites [fossil], etc.).</p>

<p>Class III. The <i>Malacopoda</i> (<i>Peripatus</i>, a curious genus of
worm-like creatures, found in the tropics, and allied to the Myriapods
in some important respects).</p>

<p>Class IV. The <i>Myriapoda</i> (Centipedes, etc.).</p>

<p>Class V. The <i>Arachnida</i> (Spiders, Mites, etc.).</p>

<p>Class VI. The <i>Insecta</i> (Insects).</p>

<p>That branch of zo&ouml;logy which treats of insects is known as
entomology.</p>

<p>The <i>Insecta</i> have been variously subdivided by different scientific
writers, but the following subdivision has much in it to commend
it, and will suffice as an outline for the guidance of the
advanced student.</p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Class VI. Insecta (Insects proper)</span></p>

<p>It will be seen by glancing at the foregoing table that the
butterflies and moths are included as suborders in the tenth
group of the list, to which is applied the name <i>Lepidoptera</i>.
This word, like most other scientific words, is derived from the
Greek, and is compounded of the noun (<i>&#955;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;</i>), which signifies
a <i>scale</i>, and the noun (<i>&#955;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;</i>), which signifies a
<i>wing</i>. The butterflies and moths together constitute the order of
scale-winged insects. The appropriateness of this name will no
doubt be at once recognized by every reader, who, having perhaps
unintentionally rubbed off some of the minute scales which clothe
the wings of a butterfly, has taken the trouble to examine them
under a microscope, or who has attentively read what has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[ 61]</a></span>
said upon this subject in the first chapter of this book. By referring
again to the classification which has been given, it will be
noted that the last four orders in the list agree in that the creatures
included within them undergo for the most part what is
known as a complete metamorphosis; that is to say, they pass
through four successive stages of development, existing first as
eggs, then as worm-like larv&aelig;, or caterpillars, then as pup&aelig;, and
finally as perfect, fully developed insects, gifted for the most part
with the power of flight, and capable of reproducing their kind.
All of this has been to some extent already elucidated in the first
chapter of the present volume, but it may be well to remind the
reader of these facts at this point.</p>

</div>

<p>A question which is frequently asked by those who are not
familiar with the subject relates to the manner in which it is
possible to distinguish between moths and butterflies. A partial
answer can be made in the light of the habits of the two classes
of lepidoptera. Butterflies are diurnal in their habits, flying between
sunrise and dusk, and very rarely taking the wing at night.
This habit is so universal that these insects are frequently called
by entomologists "the diurnal lepidoptera," or are simply spoken
of as "diurnals." It is, however, true that many species of moths
are also diurnal in their habits, though the great majority of them
are nocturnal, or crepuscular, that is, flying at the dusk of the
evening, or in the twilight of the early morning. Upon the basis
of mere habit, then, we are able only to obtain a partial clue to the
distinction between the two suborders. A more definite distinction
is based upon structure,
and specifically upon
the structure of the antenn&aelig;.
Butterflies have
long, thread-like antenn&aelig;,
provided with a swelling
at the extremity, giving
them a somewhat club-shaped
appearance (Fig. 76).
This form of antenn&aelig;
is very unusual among the moths, and only occurs in a few
rare genera, found in tropical countries, which seem to represent
connecting-links between the butterflies and the moths. All the
true moths which are found within the limits of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[ 62]</a></span>
States and Canada have antenn&aelig; which are not club-shaped, but
are of various other forms. Some moths have thread-like antenn&aelig;
tapering to a fine point; others have feather-shaped antenn&aelig;;
others still have antenn&aelig;
which are
prismatic in form,
and provided with
a little hook, or
spur, at the end;
and there are many
modifications and
variations of these
forms. The club-shaped
form of the antenn&aelig; of butterflies has led naturalists to call
them <i>Rhopalocera</i>, as has been already explained in speaking of
this subject on page 17. Moths are called <i>Heterocera</i>. The word
<i>Heterocera</i> is compounded of the Greek word (<i>&#7953;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</i>), meaning
<i>other</i>, and the Greek word (<i>&#954;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#963;</i>), meaning a <i>horn</i>. They
are lepidoptera which have antenn&aelig; which are <i>other than club-shaped</i>.
Besides the distinctions which exist in the matter of the
form of the antenn&aelig;, there are distinctions in the veins of the wings,
and in the manner of carrying them when at rest or in flight, which
are quite characteristic of the two groups; but all of these things
the attentive student will quickly learn for himself by observation.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Scientific Arrangement.</i>&mdash;Having thus cast a passing glance at
the differences which exist between moths and butterflies, we
take up the question of the subdivision of the butterflies into
natural groups. Various systems of arranging butterflies have
been suggested from time to time by learned writers, and for a
knowledge of these systems the student may consult works
which treat of them at length. It is sufficient for beginners, for
whom this book is principally written, to observe that in modern
science, for purposes of convenience, as well as from regard for
essential truth, all individuals are looked upon as belonging to a
<i>species</i>. A species includes all those individuals, which have a
common ancestry, and are so related in form and structure as to
be manifestly separable from all other similarly constituted assemblages
of individuals. For instance, all the large cats having
a tawny skin, and in the male a shaggy mane, constitute a species,
which we call the lion; the eagles in the eastern United States,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[ 63]</a></span>
which in adult plumage have a snow-white head and neck and a
white tail, constitute a species, which we know as the "white-headed"
or "bald-headed" eagle. Species may then be grouped
together, and those which are manifestly closely related to one another
are regarded as forming a natural assemblage of species, to
which we give the name of a <i>genus</i>. For example, all the large
cats, such as the lion, the tiger, the puma, and the jaguar, are
grouped together by naturalists, and form a genus to which is
given the Latin name <i>Felis</i>, meaning <i>cat</i>. The name of the genus
always comes before that of the species. Thus the tiger is
spoken of scientifically as <i>Felis tigris</i>. The genera which are
closely related to one another may again be assembled as <i>subfamilies</i>;
and the subfamilies may be united to form <i>families</i>.
For instance, all the various genera of cats form a family, which
is known as the <i>Felid&aelig;</i>, or the Cat Family. A group of families
constitutes a <i>suborder</i> or an <i>order</i>. The cats belong to the <i>Carnivora</i>,
or order of flesh-eating animals.</p>

<p>In zo&ouml;logy family names are formed with the termination
<i>-id&aelig;</i>, and subfamily names with the termination<i>-in&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>Everything just said in regard to the classification of the higher
animals applies likewise to butterflies. Let us take as an illustration
the common milkweed butterfly. Linn&aelig;us for a fanciful
reason gave this insect the name <i>Plexippus</i>. This is its
specific name, by which it is distinguished from all other butterflies.
It belongs to the genus <i>Anosia</i>. The genus <i>Anosia</i> is one
of the genera which make up the subfamily of the <i>Eupl&oelig;in&aelig;</i>.
The <i>Eupl&oelig;in&aelig;</i> belong to the great family of the <i>Nymphalid&aelig;</i>.
The <i>Nymphalid&aelig;</i> are a part of the suborder of the <i>Rhopalocera</i>,
or true butterflies, one of the two great subdivisions of the order
<i>Lepidoptera</i>, belonging to the great class <i>Insecta</i>, the highest class
in the subkingdom of the <i>Arthropoda</i>. The matter may be represented
in a tabular form, in the reverse order from that which
has been given:</p>

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[ 64]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Varieties.</i>&mdash;A still further subdivision is in some cases recognized
as necessary. A species which has a wide range over an
extensive territory may vary in different parts of the territory
within which it is found. The butterflies of certain common
European species are found also in Japan and Corea, but, as a
rule, they are much larger in the latter countries than they are in
Europe, and in some cases more brightly colored. Naturalists
have therefore distinguished the Asiatic from the European form
by giving the former what is known as a varietal name. Similar
differences occur among butterflies on the continent of North
America. The great yellow and black-barred swallowtail butterfly
known as <i>Papilio turnus</i> occurs from Florida to Alaska.
But the specimens from Alaska are always much smaller than those
from other regions, and have a very dwarfed appearance. This
dwarfed form constitutes what is known as a local race, or variety,
of the species. The members of a species which occur upon an
island frequently differ in marked respects from specimens which
occur upon the adjacent mainland. By insulation and the process
of through-breeding the creature has come to acquire characteristics
which separate it in a marked degree from the closely allied
continental form, and yet not sufficiently to justify us in treating
it as a distinct species. It represents what is known as an insular
race, or variety, and we give it therefore a varietal name.
Naturalists also distinguish between seasonal, dimorphic, melanic,
and albino forms. Names descriptive or designatory of
these forms are frequently applied to them. All of this will become
plainer in the course of the study of the succeeding pages,
and in the effort to classify specimens which the student will
make.</p>

<p><i>Sex.</i>&mdash;The designation of the sex is important in the case of
all well-ordered collections of zo&ouml;logical specimens. As a measure
of convenience, the male is usually indicated by the sign of
Mars, &#9794;, while the female is indicated by the sign of Venus, &#9793;.
The inscription, "<i>Argynnis Diana</i>, &#9794;," therefore means that
the specimen is a male of <i>Argynnis Diana</i>, and the inscription,
"<i>Argynnis Diana</i>, &#9793;," means that the specimen is a female of
the same species. These signs are invariably employed by naturalists
to mark the sexes.</p>

<p><i>The Division of Butterflies into Families.</i>&mdash;Without attempting
to go deeply into questions of classification at the present point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[ 65]</a></span>
it will be well for us to note the subdivisions which have been
made into the larger groups, known as families, and to show
how butterflies belonging to one or the other of these may be
distinguished from one another. There are five of these families
represented within the territory of which this book takes notice.
These five families are the following:</p>

<div class="marj">
<p class="noin">
1. The <span class="smcap">Nymphalid&aelig;</span>, or "Brush-footed Butterflies."<br />
2. The <span class="smcap">Lemoniid&aelig;</span>, or "Metal-marks."<br />
3. The <span class="smcap">Lyc&aelig;nid&aelig;</span>, or "Blues," "Coppers," and "Hair-streaks".<br />
4. The <span class="smcap">Papilionid&aelig;</span>, or the "Swallowtails" and their allies.<br />
5. The <span class="smcap">Hesperiid&aelig;</span>, or the "Skippers."
</p></div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Nymphalid&aelig;</span>, the "Brush-footed Butterflies."</p>

<p>The butterflies of this family may be distinguished as a great
class from all other butterflies by the fact that in <i>both sexes the
first, or prothoracic, pair of legs is greatly dwarfed, useless for
walking, and therefore carried folded up against the breast</i>.
From this peculiarity they have also been called the "Four-footed
Butterflies." This is the largest of all the families of the butterflies,
and has been subdivided into many subfamilies. Some of
the genera are composed of small species, but most of the genera
are made up of medium-sized or large species. The family is
geologically very ancient, and most of the fossil butterflies which
have been discovered belong to it. The caterpillars are in most
of the subfamilies provided with horny or fleshy projections.
The chrysalids always hang suspended by the tail.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lemoniid&aelig;</span>, the "Metal-marks."</p>

<p>This family is distinguished from others by the fact that <i>the
males have four ambulatory or walking feet, while the females have
six such feet. The antenn&aelig; are relatively longer than in the Lyc&aelig;nid&aelig;.</i>
The butterflies belonging to this great group are mostly
confined to the tropics of the New World, and only a few genera
and species are included in the region covered by this volume.
They are usually quite small, but are colored in a bright and odd
manner, spots and checkered markings being very common. Many
are extremely brilliant in their colors. <i>The caterpillars are small
and contracted. Some are said to have chrysalids which are suspended;
others have chrysalids girdled and attached at the anal
extremity, like the Lyc&aelig;nid&aelig;. The butterflies in many genera
have the habit of alighting on the under side of leaves, with their
wings expanded.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[ 66]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lyc&aelig;nid&aelig;</span>, the "Gossamer-winged Butterflies."</p>

<p>This great family comprises the butterflies which are familiarly
known as the "hair-streaks," the "blues," and the "coppers."
<i>The males have four and the females six walking feet. The caterpillars
are small, short, and slug-shaped. The chrysalids are
provided with a girdle, are attached at the end of the abdomen, and
lie closely appressed to the surface upon which they have undergone
transformation.</i> Blue is a very common color in this family,
which includes some of the gayest of the small forms which are
found in the butterfly world. <i>In alighting they always carry their
wings folded together and upright.</i></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Papilionid&aelig;</span>, the "Swallowtails" and their allies.</p>

<p>These butterflies <i>have six walking feet in both sexes. The caterpillars
are elongate, and in some genera provided with osmateria,
or protrusive organs secreting a powerful and disagreeable odor.
The chrysalids are elongate, attached at the anal extremity, and
held in place by a girdle of silk, but not closely appressed to the
surface upon which they have undergone transformation.</i></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hesperiid&aelig;</span>, or the "Skippers."</p>

<p>They are generally <i>small in size, with stout bodies, very quick
and powerful in fight. They have six walking feet in both sexes.
The tibi&aelig; of the hind feet, with few exceptions, have spurs. The
caterpillars are cylindrical, smooth, tapering forward and backward
from the middle, and generally having large globular heads.
For the most part they undergo transformation into chrysalids
which have a girdle and an anal hook, or cremaster, in a loose cocoon,
composed of a few threads of silk</i>, and thus approximate the
moths in their habits. The genus <i>Megathymus</i> has the curious
habit of burrowing in its larval stage in the underground stems
of the yucca.</p>

<p>To one or the other of these five families all the butterflies,
numbering about six hundred and fifty species, which are found
from the Rio Grande of Texas to the arctic circle, can be referred.</p>

<p><i>Scientific Names.</i>&mdash;From what has been said it is plain to the
reader that the student of this delightful branch of science is certain
to be called upon to use some rather long and, at first sight,
uncouth words in the pursuit of the subject. But experience,
that best of teachers, will soon enable him to master any little
difficulties which may arise from this source, and he will come
finally to recognize how useful these terms are in designating dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[ 67]</a></span>tinctions
which exist, but which are often wholly overlooked by
the uneducated and unobservant. It is not, however, necessary
that the student should at the outset attempt to tax his memory
with all of the long scientific names which he encounters in this
and similar books. The late Dr. Horn of Philadelphia, who was
justly regarded, during the latter years of his life, as the most
eminent student of the <i>Coleoptera</i>, or beetles, of North America,
once said to the writer that he made it a religious duty not to try
to remember all the long scientific names belonging to the thousands
of species in his collection, but was content to have them
attached to the pins holding the specimens in his cabinets, where
he could easily refer to them. The student who is engaged in
collecting and studying butterflies will very soon come, almost without
effort, to know their names, but it is not a sin to forget them.</p>

<p>In writing about butterflies it is quite customary to abbreviate
the generic name by giving merely its initial. Thus in writing
about the milkweed butterfly, <i>Anosia plexippus</i>, the naturalist
will designate it as "<i>A. plexippus</i>." To the specific name he
will also attach the name of the man who gave this specific name
to the insect. As Linn&aelig;us was the first to name this insect, it is
proper to add his name, when writing of it, or to add an abbreviation
of his name, as follows: "<i>A. plexippus</i>, Linn&aelig;us," or
"Linn." In speaking about butterflies it is quite common to
omit the generic name altogether and to use only the specific
name. Thus after returning in the evening from a collecting-trip,
I might say, "I was quite successful to-day. I took twenty
<i>Aphrodites</i>, four <i>Myrinas</i>, and two specimens of <i>Atlantis</i>." In
this case there could be no misunderstanding of my meaning. I
took specimens of three species of the genus <i>Argynnis&mdash;A.
aphrodite</i>, <i>A. myrina</i>, and <i>A. atlantis</i>; but it is quite enough
to designate them by the specific names, without reference to
their generic classification.</p>

<p><i>Synonyms.</i>&mdash;It is a law among scientific men that the name
first given to an animal or plant shall be its name and shall have
priority over all other names. Now, it has happened not infrequently
that an author, not knowing that a species has been described
already, has redescribed it under another name. Such a
name applied a second time to a species already described is
called a <i>synonym</i>, and may be published after the true name.
Sometimes species have had a dozen or more different names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[ 68]</a></span>
applied to them by different writers, but all such names rank as
synonyms according to the law of priority.</p>

<p><i>Popular Names.</i>&mdash;Common English names for butterflies are
much in vogue in England and Scotland, and there is no reason
why English names should not be given to butterflies, as well as
to birds and to plants. In the following pages this has been done
to a great extent. I have used the names coined by Dr. S.H. Scudder
and by others, so far as possible, and have in other cases
been forced myself to coin names which seemed to be appropriate,
in the hope that they may come ultimately to be widely
used. The trouble is that ordinary people do not take pains to
observe and note the distinctions which exist among the lower
animals. The vocabulary of the common farmer, or even of the
ordinary professional man, is bare of terms to point out correctly
the different things which come under the eye. All insects are
"bugs" to the vulgar, and even the airy butterfly, creature of grace
and light, is put into the same category with roaches and fleas.
Apropos of the tendency to classify as "bugs" all things which
creep and are small, it may be worth while to recall the story,
which Frank Buckland tells in his "Log-book of a Fisherman and
Naturalist," of an adventure which he had, when a school-boy, at
the booking-office of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway
Company in Dover. He had been for a short trip to Paris, and
had bought a monkey and a tortoise. Upon his return from
sunny France, as he was getting his ticket up to London, Jocko
stuck his head out of the bag in which his owner was carrying
him. The ticket-agent looked down and said, "You will pay
half-fare for him." "How is that?" exclaimed young Buckland.
"Well, we charge half-fare for dogs." "But this is not a dog,"
replied the indignant lad; "this is a monkey." "Makes no difference,"
was the answer; "you must pay half-fare for him."
Reluctantly the silver was laid upon the counter. Then, thrusting
his hands into the pocket of his greatcoat, Buckland drew
forth the tortoise, and, laying it down, asked, "How much do
you charge for this?" The ancient receiver of fares furbished
his spectacles, adjusted them to his nose, took a long look, and
replied, "We don't charge nothin' for them; them 's insects."
It is to be hoped that the reader of this book will in the end have
a clearer view of facts as to the classification of animals than was
possessed by the ticket-agent at Dover.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>BOOKS ABOUT NORTH AMERICAN BUTTERFLIES</h3>


<p><i>Early Writers.</i>&mdash;The earliest descriptions of North American
butterflies are found in writings which are now almost unknown,
except to the close student of science. Linn&aelig;us described and
named a number of the commoner North American species, and
some of them were figured by Charles Clerck, his pupil, whose
work entitled "Icones" was published at Stockholm in the year
1759. Clerck's work is exceedingly rare, and the writer believes
that he has in his possession the only copy in North America.
Johann Christian Fabricius, a pupil of Linn&aelig;us, who was for
some time a professor in Kiel, and attached to the court of the
King of Denmark, published between the year 1775 and the year
1798 a number of works upon the general subject of entomology,
in which he gave descriptions, very brief and unsatisfactory, of
a number of North American species. His descriptions were
written, as were those of Linn&aelig;us, in the Latin language. About
the same time that Fabricius was publishing his works, Peter
Cramer, a Dutchman, was engaged in giving to the world the
four large quartos in which he endeavored to figure and describe
the butterflies and moths of Asia, Africa, and America. Cramer's
work was entitled "Papillons Exotiques," and contained recognizable
illustrations of quite a number of the North American
forms. The book, however, is rare and expensive to-day, but
few copies of it being accessible to American students.</p>

<p>Jacob H&uuml;bner, who was born at Augsburg in the year 1761,
undertook the publication, in the early part of the present century,
of an elaborate work upon the European butterflies and moths,
parallel with which he undertook a publication upon the butterflies
and moths of foreign lands. The title of his work is "Samm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[ 70]</a></span>lung
Exotischer Schmetterlinge." To this work was added, as an
appendix, partly by H&uuml;bner and partly by his successor and co-laborer,
Karl Geyer, another, entitled "Zutr&auml;ge zur Sammlung
Exotischer Schmetterlinge." The two works together are illustrated
by six hundred and sixty-four colored plates. This great
publication contains some scattered figures of North American
species. A good copy sells for from three hundred and fifty to
four hundred dollars, or even more.</p>

<p>The first work which was devoted exclusively to an account
of the lepidoptera of North America was published in England
by Sir James Edward Smith, who was a botanist, and who gave
to the world in two volumes some of the plates which had been
drawn by John Abbot, an Englishman who lived for a number of
years in Georgia. The work appeared in two folio volumes,
bearing the date 1797. It is entitled "The Natural History of the
Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia." It contains one hundred
and four plates, in which the insects are represented in their
various stages upon their appropriate food-plants. Smith and
Abbot's work contains original descriptions of only about half a
dozen of the North American butterflies, and figures a number of
species which had been already described by earlier authors.
It is mainly devoted to the moths. This work is now rare and
commands a very high price.</p>

<p>The next important work upon the subject was published by
Dr. J.A. Boisduval of Paris, a celebrated entomologist, who was
assisted by Major John E. Leconte. The work appeared in the
year 1833, and is entitled "Histoire G&eacute;n&eacute;rale et Monographie des
Lepidopt&egrave;res et des Chenilles de l'Am&eacute;rique Septentrionale." It
contains seventy-eight colored plates, each representing butterflies
of North America, in many cases giving figures of the larva and
the chrysalis as well as of the perfect insect. The plates were
based very largely upon drawings made by John Abbot, and
represent ninety-three species, while in the text there are only
eighty-five species mentioned, some of which are not figured.
What has been said of all the preceding works is also true of this:
it is very rarely offered for sale, can only be found upon occasion,
and commands a high price.</p>

<p>In the year 1841 Dr. Thaddeus William Harris published "A
Report on the Insects of Massachusetts which are Injurious to
Vegetation." This work, which was originally brought out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[ 71]</a></span>
pursuance of an order of the legislature of Massachusetts, by
the Commissioners of the Zo&ouml;logical and Botanical Survey of the
State, was republished in 1842, and was followed by a third edition
in 1852. The last edition, revised and improved by Charles
L. Flint, Secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture,
appeared in 1862. This work contains a number of figures
and descriptions of the butterflies of New England, and, while now
somewhat obsolete, still contains a great deal of valuable information,
and is well worth being rescued by the student from the
shelves of the second-hand book-stalls in which it is now and
then to be found. For the New England student of entomology
it remains to a greater or less extent a classic.</p>

<p>In 1860 the Smithsonian Institution published a "Catalogue
of the Described Lepidoptera of North America," a compilation
prepared by the Rev. John G. Morris. This work, though very far
from complete, contains in a compact form much valuable information,
largely extracted from the writings of previous authors.
It is not illustrated.</p>

<p>With the book prepared by Dr. Morris the first period in the
development of a literature relating to our subject may be said to
close, and the reader will observe that until the end of the sixth
decade of this century very little had been attempted in the way
of systematically naming, describing, and illustrating the riches
of the insect fauna of this continent. Almost all the work, with
the exception of that done by Harris, Leconte, and Morris, had
been done by European authors.</p>

<p><i>Later Writers.</i>&mdash;At the close of the Civil War this country
witnessed a great intellectual awakening, and every department
of science began to find its zealous students. In the annals of entomology
the year 1868 is memorable because of the issue of
the first part of the great work by William H. Edwards, entitled
"The Butterflies of North America." This work has been within
the last year (1897) brought to completion with the publication of
the third volume, and stands as a superb monument to the scientific
attainments and the inextinguishable industry of its learned
author. The three volumes are most superbly illustrated, and contain
a wealth of original drawings, representing all the stages in
the life-history of numerous species, which has never been surpassed.
Unfortunately, while including a large number of the
species known to inhabit North America, the book is nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[ 72]</a></span>
not what its title would seem to imply, and is far from complete,
several hundreds of species not being represented in any
way, either in the text or in the illustrations. In spite of this
fact it will remain to the American student a classic, holding a
place in the domain of entomology analogous to that which is
held in the science of ornithology by the "Birds of America,"
by Audubon.</p>

<p>A work even more elaborate in its design and execution, contained
in three volumes, is "The Butterflies of New England," by
Dr. Samuel Hubbard Scudder, published in the year 1886. No
more superbly illustrated and exhaustive monograph on any scientific
subject has ever been published than this, and it must remain
a lasting memorial of the colossal industry and vast learning
of the author, one of the most eminent scientific men whom
America has produced.</p>

<p>While the two great works which have been mentioned have
illustrated to the highest degree not only the learning of their
authors, but the vast advances which have been made in the art
of illustration within the last thirty years, they do not stand alone
as representing the activity of students in this field. A number
of smaller, but useful, works have appeared from time to time.
Among these must be mentioned "The Butterflies of the Eastern
United States," by Professor G.H. French. This book, which
contains four hundred and two pages and ninety-three figures in
the text, was published in Philadelphia in 1886. It is an admirable
little work, with the help of which the student may learn
much in relation to the subject; but it greatly lacks in illustration,
without which all such publications are not attractive or thoroughly
useful to the student. In the same year appeared "The
Butterflies of New England," by C.J. Maynard, a quarto containing
seventy-two pages of text and eight colored plates, the
latter very poor. In 1878 Herman Strecker of Reading, Pennsylvania,
published a book entitled "Butterflies and Moths of North
America," which is further entitled "A Complete Synonymical
Catalogue." It gives only the synonymy of some four hundred
and seventy species of butterflies, and has never been continued
by the author, as was apparently his intention. It makes
no mention of the moths, except upon the title-page. For
the scientific student it has much value, but is of no value to
a beginner. The same author published in parts a work illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[ 73]</a></span>trated
by fifteen colored plates, entitled "Lepidoptera-Rhopaloceres
and Heteroceres&mdash;Indigenous and Exotic," which came out
from 1872 to 1879, and contains recognizable figures of many
North American species.</p>

<p>In 1891 there appeared in Boston, from the pen of C.J. Maynard,
a work entitled "A Manual of North American Butterflies."
This is illustrated by ten very poorly executed plates and a number
of equally poorly executed cuts in the text. The work is
unfortunately characterized by a number of serious defects which
make its use difficult and unsatisfactory for the correct determination
of species and their classification.</p>

<p>In 1893 Dr. Scudder published two books, both of them useful,
though brief, one of them entitled "The Life of a Butterfly,"
the other, "A Brief Guide to the Commoner Butterflies of the
Northern United States and Canada." Both of these books were
published in New York by Messrs. Henry Holt &amp; Co., and contain
valuable information in relation to the subject, being to a
certain extent an advance upon another work published in 1881
by the same author and firm, entitled "Butterflies."</p>

<p><i>Periodical Literature.</i>&mdash;The reader must not suppose that the
only literature relating to the subject that we are considering is to
be found in the volumes that have been mentioned. The original
descriptions and the life-histories of a large number of the species
of the butterflies of North America have originally appeared in the
pages of scientific periodicals and in the journals and proceedings
of different learned societies. Among the more important publications
which are rich in information in regard to our theme
may be mentioned the publications relating to entomology issued
by the United States National Museum, the United States Department
of Agriculture, and by the various American commonwealths,
chief among the latter being Riley's "Missouri Reports." Exceedingly
valuable are many of the papers contained in the
"Transactions of the American Entomological Society," "Psyche,"
the "Bulletin of the Brooklyn Entomological Society" (1872-85),
"Papilio" (1881-84), "Entomologica Americana" (1885-90),
the "Journal of the New York Entomological Society," the
"Canadian Entomologist," and "Entomological News." All of
these journals are mines of original information, and the student
who proposes to master the subject thoroughly will do well to
obtain, if possible, complete sets of these periodicals, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[ 74]</a></span>
of a number of others which might be mentioned, and to subscribe
for such of them as are still being published.</p>

<p>There are a number of works upon general entomology, containing
chapters upon the diurnal lepidoptera, which may be consulted
with profit. Among the best of these are the following:
"A Guide to the Study of Insects," by A.S. Packard, Jr., M.D.
(Henry Holt &amp; Co., New York, 1883, pp. 715, 8vo); "A Textbook
of Entomology," by Alpheus S. Packard, M.D., etc. (The
Macmillan Company, New York, 1898, pp. 729, 8vo); "A Manual
for the Study of Insects," by John Henry Comstock (Comstock
Publishing Company, Ithaca, New York, 1895, pp. 701, 8vo).</p>

<h2>ORDER LEPIDOPTERA<br />
SUBORDER RHOPALOCERA (BUTTERFLIES)</h2>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2>FAMILY I</h2>

<h3>NYMPHALID&AElig; (THE BRUSH-FOOTED BUTTERFLIES)</h3>


<p>The family of the Nymphalid&aelig; is composed of butterflies
which are of medium and large size, though a few of the genera
are made up of species which are quite small. They may be
distinguished from all other butterflies by the fact that the first
pair of legs in both sexes is atrophied or greatly reduced in size,
so that they cannot be used in walking, but are carried folded up
upon the breast. The fore feet, except in the case of the female of
the snout-butterflies (Libythein&aelig;), are without tarsal claws, and
hence the name "Brush-footed Butterflies" has been applied to
them. As the anterior pair of legs is apparently useless, they
have been called "The Four-footed Butterflies," which is scientifically
a misnomer.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs of the Nymphalid&aelig;, for the most part, are
dome-shaped or globular, and are marked with raised longitudinal
lines extending from the summit toward the base over the entire
surface or over the upper portion of the egg. Between these
elevations are often found finer and less elevated cross-lines. In
a few genera the surface of the eggs is covered with reticulation
arranged in geometrical patterns (see Fig. 1).</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillars of the Nymphalid&aelig;, as they
emerge from the egg, have heads the diameter of which is larger
than that of the body, and covered with a number of wart-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[ 78]</a></span>
elevations from which hairs arise. The body of the immature
larva generally tapers from before backward (see Plate III, Figs. 7
and 11). The mature larva is cylindrical in form, sometimes, as
in the Satyrin&aelig;, thicker in the middle. Often one or more of the
segments are greatly swollen in whole or in part. The larv&aelig; are
generally ornamented with fleshy projections or branching spines.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalids.</i>&mdash;The chrysalids are for the most part angular, and
often have strongly marked projections. As a rule, they hang with
the head downward, having the cremaster, or anal hook, attached
to a button of silk woven to the under surface of a limb of a tree,
a stone, or some other projecting surface. A few boreal species
construct loose coverings of threads of silk at the roots of grasses,
and here undergo their transformations. The chrysalids are frequently
ornamented with golden or silvery spots.</p>

<p>This is the largest of all the families of butterflies, and it is
also the most widely distributed. It is represented by species
which have their abode in the cold regions of the far North and
upon the lofty summits of mountains, where summer reigns for
but a few weeks during the year; and it is enormously developed
in equatorial lands, including here some of the most gloriously
colored species in the butterfly world. But although these insects
appear to have attained their most superb development in
the tropics, they are more numerous in the temperate regions
than other butterflies, and a certain fearlessness, and fondness
for the haunts of men, which seems to characterize some of them,
has brought them more under the eyes of observers. The literature
of poetry and prose which takes account of the life of
the butterfly has mainly dealt with forms belonging to this great
assemblage of species.</p>

<p>In the classification of the brush-footed butterflies various
subdivisions have been suggested by learned authors, but the
species found in the United States and the countries lying northward
upon the continent may be all included in the following six
groups, or subfamilies:</p>

<div class="marj">
<p class="noin">
1. The <i>Eupl&oelig;in&oelig;</i>, the Eupl&oelig;ids.<br />
2. The <i>Ithomiin&oelig;</i>, the Ithomiids.<br />
3. The <i>Heliconiin&oelig;</i>, the Heliconians.<br />
4. The <i>Nymphalin&oelig;</i>, the Nymphs.<br />
5. The <i>Satyrin&oelig;</i>, the Satyrs.<br />
6. The <i>Libythein&oelig;</i>, the Snout-butterflies.
</p></div>

<p>The insects belonging to these different subfamilies may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[ 79]</a></span>
distinguished by the help of the following analytical table, which
is based upon that of Professor Comstock, given in his "Manual
for the Study of Insects" (p. 396), which in turn is based
upon that of Dr. Scudder, in "The Butterflies of New England"
(vol. i, p. 115).</p>

<p>We now proceed to present the various genera and species of
this family which occur within the territorial limits of which this
book treats. The reader will do well to accompany the study of
the descriptions, which are at most mere sketches, by a careful
examination of the figures in the plates. In this way a very clear
idea of the different species can in most instances be obtained.
But with the study of the book should always go, if possible,
the study of the living things themselves. Knowledge of nature
founded upon books is at best second-hand. To the fields and
the woods, then, net in hand! Splendid as may be the sight of a
great collection of butterflies from all parts of the world, their
wings</p>

</div></div>


<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Large butterflies; head large; the antenn&aelig; inserted
on the summit, stout, naked, that is to say, not covered with
scales, the club long and not broad; palpi stout; the thorax somewhat
compressed, with the top arched. The abdomen is moderately
stout, bearing on the eighth segment, on either side, in the
case of the male, clasps which are quite conspicuous. The fore
wings are greatly produced at the apex and more or less excavated
about the middle of the outer border; the hind wings are rounded
and generally much smaller than the fore wings; the outer margin
is regular, without tails, and the inner margin is sometimes
channeled so as to enfold the abdomen. The fore legs are
greatly atrophied in the male, less so in the female; these atrophied
legs are not provided with claws, but on the other legs the
claws are well developed.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs are ovate conical, broadly flattened at the base
and slightly truncated at the top, with many longitudinal ribs
and transverse cross-ridges (see Fig. 4).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a></span></div>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;On emerging from the chrysalis the head is not
larger than the body; the body has a few scattered hairs on each
segment. On reaching maturity the head is small, the body large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[ 81]</a></span>
cylindrical, without hair, and conspicuously banded with dark
stripes upon a lighter ground, and on some of the segments there
are generally erect fleshy processes of considerable length (see
Fig. 16). The caterpillars feed upon different species of the milkweed
(<i>Asclepias</i>).</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is relatively short and thick, rounded,
with very few projections, tapers very rapidly over the posterior
part of the abdomen, and is suspended by a long cremaster from
a button of silk (see Fig. 24). The chrysalis is frequently ornamented
with golden or silver spots.</p>

<p>This subfamily reaches its largest development in the tropical
regions of Asia. Only one genus is represented in our fauna,
the genus <i>Anosia</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus ANOSIA, H&uuml;bner</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Large-sized butterflies; fore wings long, greatly
produced at the apex, having a triangular outline, the outer margin
approximately as long as the inner
margin; the costal border is regularly
bowed; the outer border is slightly excavated,
the outer angle rounded; the hind
wings are well rounded, the costal border
projecting just at the base, the inner margin
likewise projecting at the base and
depressed so as to form a channel clasping
the abdomen. On the edge of the
first median nervule of the male, about
its middle, there is a scent-pouch covered
with scales.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 78.</a>&mdash;Neuration of the
genus <i>Anosia</i>.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is ovate conical, ribbed
perpendicularly with many raised cross-lines
between the ridges. The eggs are
pale green in color.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is cylindrical,
fleshy, transversely wrinkled, and has on the second thoracic
and eighth abdominal segment pairs of very long and slender
fleshy filaments; the body is ornamented by dark bands upon a
greenish-yellow ground-color; the filaments are black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[ 82]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is stout, cylindrical, rapidly tapering
on the abdomen, and is suspended from a button of silk by
a long cremaster. The color of the chrysalis is pale green, ornamented
with golden spots.</p>

<p>The larv&aelig; of the genus <i>Anosia</i> feed for the most part upon
the varieties of milkweed (<i>Asclepias</i>), and they are therefore
called "milkweed butterflies." There are two species of the
genus found in our fauna, one, <i>Anosia plexippus</i>, Linn&aelig;us, which
is distributed over the entire continent as far north as southern
Canada, and the other, <i>Anosia berenice</i>, Cramer, which is confined
to the extreme southwestern portions of the United States,
being found in Texas and Arizona.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Anosia plexippus</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate VII, Fig. 1, &#9794; (The
Monarch).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper surface of the wings of this butterfly is
bright reddish, with the borders and veins broadly black, with
two rows of white spots on the outer borders and two rows of
pale spots of moderately large size across the apex of the fore
wings. The males have the wings less broadly bordered with
black than the females, and on the first median nervule of the
hind wings there is a black scent-pouch.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is ovate conical, and is well represented in
Fig. 4 in the introductory chapter of this book.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is bright yellow or greenish-yellow,
banded with shining black, and furnished with black fleshy
thread-like appendages before and behind. It likewise is well
delineated in Fig. 16, as well as in Plate III, Fig. 5.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is about an inch in length, pale
green, spotted with gold (see Fig. 24, and Plate IV, Figs. 1-3).</p>

<p>The butterfly is believed to be polygoneutic, that is to say,
many broods are produced annually; and it is believed by writers
that with the advent of cold weather these butterflies migrate
to the South, the chrysalids and caterpillars which may be undeveloped
at the time of the frosts are destroyed, and that
when these insects reappear, as they do every summer, they
represent a wave of migration coming northward from the
warmer regions of the Gulf States. It is not believed that any
of them hibernate in any stage of their existence. This insect
sometimes appears in great swarms on the eastern and southern
coasts of New Jersey in late autumn. The swarms pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[ 83]</a></span>
southward are arrested by the ocean. The writer has seen
stunted trees on the New Jersey coast in the middle of October,
when the foliage has already fallen, so completely covered with
clinging masses of these butterflies as to present the appearance
of trees in full leaf (Fig. 79).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>This butterfly is a great migrant, and within quite recent years,
with Yankee instinct, has crossed the Pacific, probably on merchant
vessels, the chrysalids being possibly concealed in bales of
hay, and has found lodgment in Australia, where it has greatly
multiplied in the warmer parts of the Island Continent, and has
thence spread northward and westward, until in its migrations it
has reached Java and Sumatra, and long ago took possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[ 84]</a></span>
the Philippines. Moving eastward on the lines of travel, it
has established a more or less precarious foothold for itself in
southern England, as many as two or three dozen of these butterflies
having been taken in a single year in the United Kingdom. It
is well established at the Cape Verde Islands, and in a short time
we may expect to hear of it as having taken possession of the
continent of Africa, in which the family of plants upon which the
caterpillars feed is well represented.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Anosia berenice</b>, Cramer, Plate VII, Fig. 2, &#9794; (The
Queen).</p>

<p>This butterfly is smaller than the Monarch, and the ground-color
of the wings is a livid brown. The markings are somewhat
similar to those in <i>A. plexippus</i>, but the black borders of
the hind wings are relatively wider, and the light spots on the
apex of the fore wings are whiter and differently located, as
may be learned from the figures given in Plate VII.</p>

<p>There is a variety of this species, which has been called <b>Anosia
strigosa</b> by H.W. Bates (Plate VII, Fig. 3, &#9794;), which differs only
in that on the upper surface of the hind wings the veins as far as
the black outer margin are narrowly edged with grayish-white,
giving them a streaked appearance. This insect is found in
Texas, Arizona, and southern New Mexico.</p>

<p>All of the Eupl&oelig;in&aelig; are "protected" insects, being by nature
provided with secretions which are distasteful to birds and predaceous
insects. These acrid secretions are probably due to the
character of the plants upon which the caterpillars feed, for many
of them eat plants which are more or less rank, and some of them
even poisonous to the higher orders of animals. Enjoying on
this account immunity from attack, they have all, in the process
of time, been mimicked by species in other genera which have
not the same immunity. This protective resemblance is well illustrated
in Plate VII. The three upper figures in the plate represent,
as we have seen, species of the genus <i>Anosia</i>; the two
lower figures represent two species of the genus <i>Basilarchia</i>.
Fig. 4 is the male of <i>B. disippus</i>, a very common species in the
northern United States, which mimicks the Monarch. Fig. 5
represents the same sex of <i>B. hulstii</i>, a species which is found
in Arizona, and there flies in company with the Queen, and its
variety, <i>A. strigosa</i>, which latter it more nearly resembles.</p>

<h2>SUBFAMILY ITHOMIIN&AElig; (THE LONG-WINGS)</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>"There be Insects with little hornes proaking out before their eyes, but weak and
tender they be, and good for nothing; as the Butterflies."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pliny, Philemon Holland's</span>
Translation.</p></blockquote>


<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This subfamily is composed for the most part of
species of moderate size, though a few are quite large. The fore
wings are invariably greatly lengthened and are generally at least
twice as long as broad. The hind wings are relatively small,
rounded, and without tails. The wings in many of the genera
are transparent. The extremity of the abdomen in both sexes
extends far beyond the margin of the hind wings, but in the female
not so much as in the male. The antenn&aelig; are not clothed
with scales, and are very long and slender, with the club also long
and slender, gradually thickening to the tip, which is often drooping.
The fore legs are greatly atrophied in the males, the tibia
and tarsi in this sex being reduced to a minute knob-like appendage,
but being more strongly developed in the females.</p>

<p>The life-history of none of the species reputed to be found in our
fauna has been carefully worked out. The larv&aelig; are smooth, covered
in most genera with longitudinal rows of conical prominences.</p>

<p>The chrysalids are said to show a likeness to those of the
Eupl&oelig;in&aelig;, being short, thick, and marked with golden spots.
Some authors are inclined to view this subfamily as merely constituting
a section of the Eupl&oelig;in&aelig;. The insects are, however,
so widely unlike the true Eupl&oelig;in&aelig; that it seems well to keep
them separate in our system of classification. In appearance they
approach the Heliconians more nearly than the Eupl&oelig;ids. Ithomiid
butterflies swarm in the tropics of the New World, and several
hundreds of species are known to inhabit the hot lands of
Central and South America. But one genus is found in the Old
World, <i>Hamadryas</i>, confined to the Australian region. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[ 86]</a></span>
protected like the Eupl&oelig;ids and the Heliconians. In flight they
are said to somewhat resemble the dragon-flies of the genus
<i>Agrion</i>, their narrow wings, greatly elongated bodies, and slow,
flitting motion recalling these insects, which are known by schoolboys
as "darning-needles."</p>

<p>Three genera are said to be represented in the extreme southwestern
portion of the United States. I myself have never received
specimens of any of them which indisputably came from
localities within our limits, and no such specimens are found in
the great collection of Mr. W.H. Edwards, which is now in my
possession. A paratype of Reakirt's species, <i>Mechanitis californica</i>,
is contained in the collection of Theodore L. Mead, which I
also possess. Mr. Mead obtained it from Herman Strecker of
Reading, Pennsylvania. Reakirt gives Los Angeles as the locality
from which his type came; but whether he was right in this is open
to question, inasmuch, so far as is known, the species has not been
found in that neighborhood since described by Reakirt.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus MECHANITIS, Fabricius</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Butterflies of moderate size, with the fore wings
greatly produced, the inner margin bowed out just beyond the
base, and deeply excavated between this
projection and the inner angle. The lower
discocellular vein in the hind wings is
apparently continuous with the median
vein, and the lower radial vein being
parallel with the median nervules, the
median vein has in consequence the appearance
of being four-branched. The
submedian vein of the fore wings is
forked at the base. The costal margin
of the hind wings is clothed with tufted
erect hairs in the male sex. The fore
legs of the male are greatly atrophied,
the tarsi and the tibia being fused and
reduced to a small knob-like appendage.
The fore legs of the female are also
greatly reduced, but the tarsi and tibia are still recognizable as
slender, thread-like organs.</p>

The caterpillars are smooth, cylindrical, ornamented with rows
of short fleshy projections.</p>

<p>The chrysalids are short and stout, suspended, and marked with
golden spots.</p>

<p>There are numerous species belonging to this genus, all natives
of tropical America. The only species said to be found within
the limits of the United States occurs, if at all, in southern California.
It is, however, probably only found in the lower peninsula
of California, which is Mexican territory. No examples from
Upper California are known to the writer.</p>


<p>(1) <b>Mechanitis californica</b>, Reakirt, Plate VIII, Fig. 2, &#9794;
(The Californian Long-wing).</p>

<p>The original description given by Reakirt in the "Proceedings
of the Entomological Society of Philadelphia," vol. v, p. 223, is as
follows:</p>

<p>"Expanse, 2.45-2.56 inches. Fore wing above, brownish-black;
a basal streak over the median nervure, and two rounded spots
near the inner angle, orange-tawny; of these the outer is the
largest, sometimes the inner is yellow, and sometimes both are
nearly obsolete; a spot across the cell near its termination, much
narrower than in <i>M. isthmia</i>, and in one example reduced to a
mere dot on the median nervure; a more or less interrupted belt
across the wing from the costa to near the middle of the outer
margin, and an oblong subapical spot, yellow; in the specimen
just mentioned there is an additional yellow spot below the
medio-central veinlet.</p>

<p>"Beneath the same, suffused with orange-tawny at the base
and the inner angle, with a row of eight or nine submarginal
white spots along the outer margin.</p>

<p>"Hind wing above, orange-tawny, with a broad mesial band,
entire, and a narrow outer border, from the middle of the costa to
the anal angle, brownish-black.</p>

<p>"Beneath the same, a yellow spot on the root of the wing; a
band runs along the subcostal nervure from the base to the margin,
where it is somewhat dilated; immediately below its termination,
a mark in the form of an irregular figure 2, usually with the
upper part inordinately enlarged; between this and the base, on
the central line of the band above, three small subtriangular spots;
all these markings blackish-brown; a submarginal row of seven
white spots on the outer margin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Body brownish; wing-lappets and thorax spotted with
tawny-orange; antenn&aelig; yellowish, with the base dusky.</p>

<p>"<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Los Angeles, California."</p>

<p>The species is probably only a local race of the insect known
to naturalists as <i>M. polymnia</i>, Linn&aelig;us, as Reakirt himself admits.
The figure in the plate is from one of Reakirt's paratypes.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus CERATINIA, Fabricius</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Butterflies of medium size, very closely related in
structure to the butterflies of the genus <i>Mechanitis</i>. The peculiarity
of this genus, by which it may
be distinguished from others belonging
to this subfamily, is the fact that
the <i>lower</i> discocellular vein in the hind
wing of the male sex is strongly in angled,
while in the genus <i>Mechanitis</i>
it is the <i>middle</i> discocellular vein
of the hind wing which is bent inwardly.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown for the
most part.</p>

<p>There are at least fifty species belonging
to this genus found in the
tropical regions of America; only one
is said to occur occasionally within the
limits of the region covered by this
volume.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Ceratinia lycaste</b>, Fabricius, Plate VIII, Fig. 3, &#9794; (Lycaste).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The butterfly is rather small, wings semi-transparent,
especially at the apex of the fore wings. The ground-color
is pale reddish-orange, with the border black. There are a few
irregular black spots on the discal area of the fore wings, and
a row of minute white spots on the outer border. There is a black
band on the middle of the hind wings, curved to correspond somewhat
with the outline of the outer border. The markings on the
under side are paler. The variety <i>negreta</i>, which is represented
in the plate, has a small black spot at the end of the cell of the
hind wings, replacing the black band in the form common upon
the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a></span></div>


<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>Reakirt says that this butterfly occurs about Los Angeles, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[ 89]</a></span>
California, and the statement has been repeated by numerous
authors, who have apparently based their assertions upon Reakirt's
report. I have no personal knowledge of the occurrence of the
species within our borders. It is very abundant, however, in the
warmer parts of Mexico and Central America, and it may possibly
occur as a straggler within the United States.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus DIRCENNA, Doubleday</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Medium-sized butterflies, for the most part with
quite transparent wings. The most characteristic features of this
genus, separating it from its near allies,
are the thread-like front feet of the females,
furnished with four-jointed tarsi
(Fig. 83), the very hairy palpi,
and the wide cell of the hind
wing, abruptly terminating
about the middle of the
wing. Furthermore, in the
male sex the hind wing is
strongly bowed out about
the middle of the costal
margin, and the costal vein
tends to coalesce with the
subcostal about the middle.</p>

<p>This genus numbers a large array of species which are found in
the hottest parts of the tropics of the New World. They fairly
swarm in wooded paths amid the jungle of the Amazonian region,
and no collection, however small, is ever received from those
parts without containing specimens belonging to the group.</p>

colorless spots at the apex, on the outer borders, and on
the middle of the wing. The inner margin of the fore wing
is black. The hind wings are transparent yellowish, with a narrow
black outer border marked with small whitish spots. The body
is black, with the thorax spotted with white. Expanse, 2.75
inches.</p>

<p>The specimen figured in the plate is from Mexico. Whether
the insect has ever been taken within the limits of the United
States is uncertain. It is another of the species attributed to our
fauna by Reakirt, but which since his day has not been caught
in the nets of any of the numerous butterfly-hunters who have
searched the region in which he said it occurs. It may, however,
be found upon the borders of Mexico, in the hotter parts of
which country it is not at all uncommon. The "gentle reader"
will kindly look for it when visiting Brownsville, Texas, and
southern California, and, when finding it, herald the fact to the
entomological world.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Medium or large-sized butterflies, with the fore wings twice
as long as they are broad; the hind wings relatively small and
rounded upon the outer margin; without tails. The palpi are
produced. The antenn&aelig;, which are nearly as long as the body,
are provided at the tip with a gradually tapering club, thicker
and stouter than in the Ithomiin&aelig;, and are clothed with scales
on the upper surface. The fore legs are
very feebly developed in both sexes. The
eggs are cylindrical, twice as high as wide,
tapering rather abruptly toward the apex,
which is truncated; they are ribbed longitudinally,
with strongly developed cross-ridges,
giving the egg a somewhat pitted
appearance. The caterpillar, when emerging
from the egg, has the head somewhat
larger than the body; each segment is
clothed with hairs, which upon the first
moult are replaced by branching spines.
The caterpillar, when it reaches maturity,
is provided with six branching spines on
each segment. The chrysalis is very peculiar
in shape, and is strongly angulated and covered with curious
projections, which cause it to somewhat resemble a shriveled leaf.</p>

</div>

<p>These butterflies are extremely numerous in the tropics of the
New World, and are there represented by a number of genera which
are rich in species. Most of them are very gaily colored, the prevalent
tints being black banded with yellow or crimson, sometimes
marked with a brilliant blue luster. They are evidently very
strongly protected. Belt, in his "Naturalist in Nicaragua," tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[ 92]</a></span>
us that birds and other animals observed by him invariably refused
to eat these butterflies, although they swarm in the forests;
and he vainly endeavored to induce a monkey which was very
fond of insects to eat them, the creature revealing by his grimaces
that they were extremely distasteful to him. Mr. Wallace believes
their immunity from attack is owing to a "strong, pungent, semi-aromatic,
or medicinal odor, which seems to pervade all the juices
of their system."</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus HELICONIUS, Latreille</b></p>

<p>The description of the subfamily applies to the genus sufficiently
well to obviate the necessity of a more particular description, as
there is but a single species in our fauna.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Heliconius charitonius</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate VIII, Fig. 5, &#9794;
(The Yellow-barred Heliconian; The Zebra).</p>

<p>This insect is a deep black, the fore wings crossed by three
bands of yellow: one near the apex; another running from the
middle of the costa to the middle of the outer margin; a third
running along the lower edge of the cell, and bending at an
obtuse angle from the point where the first median nervule
branches toward the outer angle, at its outer extremity followed
by a small yellow dot. The hind wings are crossed by a somewhat
broad band of yellow running from the inner margin near
the base toward the outer angle, which it does not reach, and by
a submarginal curved band of paler yellow spots, gradually
diminishing in size from the inner margin toward the outer angle.
There are also a number of small twinned whitish spots on the
margin of the hind wing near the anal angle. The body is black,
marked with yellow spots and lines; on the under side both
wings are touched with crimson at their base, and the hind wings
have some pale pinkish markings near the outer angle.</p>

<p>The caterpillar feeds upon the passion-flower. The chrysalis,
which is dark brown, has the power when disturbed of emitting
a creaking sound as it wriggles about, a property which is reported
to be characteristic of all the insects in the genus. This
butterfly is found in the hotter portions of the Gulf States, and is
rather abundant in Florida, in the region of the Indian River and
on the head waters of the St. Johns. It ranges southward all
over the lowlands of Mexico, Central America, and the Antilles.</p>

<h2>SUBFAMILY NYMPHALIN&AElig; (THE NYMPHS)</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>"Entomology extends the limits of being in new directions, so that I walk in
nature with a sense of greater space and freedom. It suggests, besides, that the
universe is not rough-hewn, but perfect in its details. Nature will bear the closest
inspection; she invites us to lay our eye level with the smallest leaf and take an
insect view of its plane."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thoreau.</span></p>

<p>"My butterfly-net and pocket magnifying-glass are rare companions for a walk
in the country."&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Hamilton Gibson</span>, <i>Sharp Eyes</i>, p. 117.</p></blockquote>


<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The butterflies of this subfamily are mainly of
moderate or large size, though some of the genera contain quite
small species. The antenn&aelig; are always more or less heavily
clothed with scales, and are usually as long as the abdomen, and
in a few cases even longer. The club is always well developed;
it is usually long, but in some genera is short and stout. The
palpi are short and stout, densely clothed with scales and hairs.
The thorax is relatively stout, in some genera exceedingly so.
The fore wings are relatively broad, the length being to the breadth
in most cases in the ratio of 5 to 3, or 3 to 2, though in a few
mimetic forms these wings are greatly produced, and narrow,
patterning after the outline of the Heliconians and Ithomiids, which
they mimic. The fore wings are in most genera produced at the
apex, and more or less strongly excavated on the outer margin
below the apex. The discoidal cell is usually less than half the
length of the wing from base to tip. It is occasionally open, but
is more generally closed at its outer extremity by discocellular
veins diminishing in thickness from the upper to the lower outer
angle of the cell. The costal nervure usually terminates midway
between the end of the cell and the tip. The two inner subcostal
nervules usually arise before the end of the cell; the outer subcostal
nervules invariably arise beyond the end of the cell.</p>

<p>The hind wings are rounded or angulated, with the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[ 94]</a></span>
border scalloped or tailed; the inner border always affords a
channel for the reception of the abdomen. The costal nervule
invariably terminates at the external angle of this wing. The
discoidal cell is frequently open, or simply closed by a slender
veinlet, which it is not always easy to detect; the anal vein is
never lacking.</p>

<p>The fore legs are greatly reduced in the male, less so in the
female.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is either somewhat globular, or else barrel-shaped,
with the sides marked with net-like elevations, or vertically
ribbed (see Figs. 1, 8, 10).</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;When first emerging from the egg the caterpillar is
generally furnished with long hairs rising singly from wart-like elevations
which are arranged either in longitudinal rows or in geometric
patterns (Fig. 85).
As the caterpillars pass
their successive moults
the hairs are transformed
into branching spines or
tubercles (see Plate III,
Figs. 28-38).</p>

hatched. (Greatly magnified.) (After Scudder.)</span>
</div>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis
invariably hangs suspended
from a button of silk, and is frequently furnished,
especially on the dorsal or upper surface, with a number of
prominences; the head is usually bifurcate, or cleft (see Plate IV,
Figs. 21, 39, etc.).</p>

<p>This is the largest of all the subfamilies of the butterflies, and
is widely distributed, including many of the most beautifully
colored and most vigorous species which are known. There are
twenty-six genera represented in our fauna, containing about one
hundred and seventy species.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus COL&AElig;NIS, Doubleday</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Butterflies of moderately large size, the fore
wings greatly produced and relatively narrow; the hind wings
evenly rounded and relatively small, of bright reddish-brown
color, with darker markings. The species are mimics, and in the
elongation of their wings reveal the influence of the Heliconians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[ 95]</a></span>
protected species, which abound in the regions in which the genus
attains its greatest development. The median vein in the upper
wing is characterized by the presence at the base of a minute,
thorn-like, external projection; the second subcostal nervule is
emitted beyond the cell; the cell of the hind
wing is open.</p>

<p>The life-history of the two species found
within our fauna has not as yet been carefully
worked out, and aside from a knowledge of
the fact that the caterpillars closely resemble
in many respects the caterpillars of the two
succeeding genera, being provided with branching
spines on their bodies, we do not know as
yet enough to give any complete account of
the early stages of these insects.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Col&aelig;nis julia</b>, Fabricius, Plate VIII,
Fig. 6, &#9794; (Julia).</p>

<p>The upper side is dark reddish-orange, the
borders are black, a black band extends from
the costa at the end of the cell to the outer margin on the line of
the third median nervule; the costal area on the hind wings is
silver-gray; the wings on the under side are pale rusty-red, mottled
with a few darker spots, principally on the costa, at the
end of the cell, and at the apex of the primaries. There are a few
crimson marks at the base of the hind wings, and two light-colored
lunules near the inner angle of the hind wings. Expanse of wing,
3.50 inches.</p>

<p>This butterfly, which mimics the genus <i>Heliconius</i> in the outline
of the wings, is very common in the tropics of America, and
only appears as an occasional visitant in southern Texas.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Col&aelig;nis delila</b>, Fabricius, Plate VIII, Fig. 4, &#9794; (Delila).</p>

<p>The Delila Butterfly very closely resembles Julia, and principally
differs in being paler in color and without the black band
extending from the costa to the outer margin of the primaries.
This species has nearly the same form and the same size as the
preceding, and, like it, is occasionally found in southern Texas.
It is very common in Central America and the West Indies. One
of the earliest memories of my childhood relates to a collection of
Jamaican butterflies in which were a number of specimens of this
butterfly, which I have always much admired.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Genus DIONE, H&uuml;bner</b>

<b>(Agraulis, <i>Boisd.-Lec.</i>)</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Head large, the antenn&aelig; moderately long, with
the club flattened; the tip of the abdomen does not extend
beyond the inner margin of the hind wings; the cell of the hind
wings is open; the primaries are elongated, nearly twice as long as
broad, with the exterior margin excavated; the secondaries at the
outer margin denticulate. The prevalent color of the upper side of
the wings is fulvous, adorned with black
spots and lines, the under side of the wings
paler brown, in some of the species laved
with pink and brilliantly adorned with large
silvery spots, as in the genus <i>Argynnis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Conoidal, truncated on top, with
fourteen ribs running from the apex to the
base, between which are rows of elevated
stri&aelig;, causing the surface to appear to be
covered with quadrangular pits.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is cylindrical in
its mature stage, tapering a little from the
middle toward the head, which is somewhat
smaller than the body. The head and
each segment of the body are adorned with
branching spines.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 87.</a>&mdash;Neuration of the
genus <i>Dione</i>.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is suspended, and has on the dorsal
surface of the abdomen a number of small projections. At the
point where the abdominal and thoracic segments unite on the
dorsal side there is a deep depression, succeeded on the middle
of the thorax by a rounded elevation composed of the wing-cases.
At the vertex of the chrysalis there is a conical projection; on the
ventral side the chrysalis is bowed outwardly.</p>

<p>This genus is confined to the New World, and contains five
species. It is closely related to the genus <i>Col&oelig;nis</i> on the one
hand and to the genus <i>Argynnis</i> on the other. It is distinguished
from <i>Col&oelig;nis</i> by the more robust structure of the palpi, which
closely approximate in form the palpi of the genus <i>Argynnis</i>. It
is distinguished from the species of the genus <i>Argynnis</i> by the
form of the wings and by the open cell of the secondaries. The
larva feeds upon the different species of the genus <i>Passiflora</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[ 97]</a></span>
I cannot at all agree with those who have recently classed this
butterfly with the Heliconians. In spite of certain resemblances
in the early stages between the insect we are considering and
the early stages of some of the Heliconians, and in spite of the
shape of the wings, which are remarkably elongated, there are
structural peculiarities enough to compel us to keep this insect
in the ranks of the Nymphalin&aelig;, where it has been placed for
sixty years by very competent and critical observers. In a popular
work like this it manifestly is out of place to enter into a
lengthy discussion of a question of this character, but it seems
proper to call attention to the fact that in the judgment of the
writer the location of this genus in the preceding subfamily does
violence to obvious anatomical facts.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Dione vanill&aelig;</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate VIII, Fig. 7, &#9794; (The Gulf
Fritillary).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side is bright fulvous; the veins on the
fore wings are black, very heavy near the tip; there are four
black spots on the outer border, and three discal spots of the
same color; there are three irregular black spots toward the end
of the cell, pupiled with white; the hind wings have a black
border inclosing rounded spots of the ground-color; between the
base and the outer margin there are three or four black spots; the
under side of the fore wings is light orange, the markings of
the upper side showing through upon the under side; the apex
of the front wing is brown, inclosing light silvery spots; the secondaries
are brown, with numerous elongated bright silver spots
and patches. The female does not differ from the male, except
that she is darker and the markings are heavier. Expanse, 2.50-3.25
inches.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is cylindrical, with the head
somewhat smaller than the body, pale yellowish-brown in color,
marked with longitudinal dark-brown bands, of which the two
upon the side are deeper in color than the one upon the back,
which latter is sometimes almost entirely effaced; the base is
slaty-black. There are orange spots about the spiracles. There
are six rows of black branching spines upon the body, and two
similar spines upon the head, these latter somewhat recurved.
The feet and legs are black. The caterpillar feeds upon the
various species of passion-flower which are found in the Southern
States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[ 98]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is dark brown, marked with a few

southward to Arizona and California. It is abundant also in the
Antilles and Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Butterflies of medium size, having wings of a
yellowish-brown color, marked with black, the under side of
the wings devoid of silvery spots such as are found in the genera
<i>Dione</i> and <i>Argynnis</i>. The palpi have
the second joint strongly developed, increasing
in thickness from behind forward, and
thickly covered with long hair; the third joint
is very small and pointed; the antenn&aelig; are terminated
by a conspicuous pear-shaped club. The
cell of the fore wing is closed by a very feeble
lower discocellular vein, which unites with the
median vein at the origin of the second median
nervule; the cell of the hind wing is open,
though occasionally there are traces of a feebly
developed lower discocellular vein on this wing.
The outer margin of the fore wing is slightly excavated
below the apex; the outer margin of the hind wing is somewhat
strongly produced at the end of the third median nervule.</p>

<p>There are two species of this genus, both of which are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[ 99]</a></span>
within the United States, and range southwardly over the greater
portion of Central and South America.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Euptoieta claudia</b>, Cramer, Plate VIII, Fig. 9, &#9794; (The
Variegated Fritillary).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side of both wings is dull ferruginous,
darker toward the base, crossed by an irregular black median
line, which is darker, broader, and more zigzag on the fore wing
than on the hind wing. This line is followed outwardly on both
wings by a pair of more or less wavy limbal lines, inclosing
between them a series of round blackish spots. The outer margin
is black, with the fringes pale fulvous, checkered with black
at the end of each nervule. At the end of the cell in the fore
wing there are two black lines inclosing paler fulvous spots, and
both wings near the base have some curved black lines. On the
under side the fore wings are marked somewhat as on the upper
side, but paler in color, with a large apical patch of brownish-gray
broken by a transverse band of darker brown. The hind
wings are dark brown, with the markings of the upper side
obscurely repeated; they are mottled with gray and crossed by a
broad central band of pale buff.</p>

<p>The species varies very much, according to locality, both in size
and in the depth of the markings. Expanse, 1.75-2.75 inches.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is conoidal, relatively taller than the eggs of
the genus <i>Argynnis</i>, which closely resemble it. There is a
depression at the apex, surrounded by a serrated rim, formed by
the ends of the vertical ribs, of which there are about twenty,
some longer and some shorter, about half of them reaching from
the apex to the base. Between these vertical ribs there are a
multitude of smaller cross-ridges.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is cylindrical, reddish-yellow in
color, marked with two brown lateral bands and a series of white
spots upon the back. There are six rows of short branching
spines upon the body, which are black in color; the two uppermost
of these spines on the first segment are much elongated
and are directed forward. The head is smaller than the body in
the mature caterpillar, and is black. On the under side the caterpillar
is pale or whitish; the legs are blackish-brown. It feeds
upon the passion-flower.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is pearly-white, marked with black
spots and longitudinal streaks.</p>

<p>This species has been taken as far north as Long Island and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[ 100]</a></span>
Connecticut, though it is a very rare visitant in New England; it
is quite common in Virginia and thence southward, and occurs
not infrequently in southern Illinois and Indiana, ranging westward
and southward over the entire continent to the Isthmus of
Panama, and thence extending over the South American continent,
wherever favorable conditions occur.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Euptoieta hegesia</b>, Cramer, Plate VIII, Fig. 8, &#9794; (The
Mexican Fritillary).</p>

<p>The upper side is marked very much as in the preceding
species, but all the lines are finer and somewhat more regular,
and the basal and discal areas of the hind wings are without dark
spots in most specimens. The under side is less mottled and
more uniformly dark rusty-brown than in <i>E. claudia</i>. Expanse,
about 2 inches.</p>

<p>The life-history of this species has not as yet been thoroughly
worked out, but there is every reason to believe that the insect
in its early stages very closely approaches the Variegated Fritillary.
It is a Southern form, and only occasionally is taken in
Arizona and southern California. It is common in Central and
South America.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"July is the gala-time of butterflies. Most of them have just left the chrysalis,
and their wings are perfect and very fresh in color. All the sunny places are bright
with them, yellow and red and white and brown, and great gorgeous fellows in
rich velvet-like dresses of blue-black, orange, green, and maroon. Some of them
have their wings scalloped, some fringed, and some plain; and they are ornamented
with brilliant borders and fawn-colored spots and rows of silver crescents....
They circle about the flowers, fly across from field to field, and rise swiftly in the
air; little ones and big ones, common ones and rare ones, but all bright and airy
and joyous&mdash;a midsummer carnival of butterflies."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frank H. Sweet.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Butterflies of medium or large size, generally
with the upper surface of the wings reddish-fulvous, with well-defined
black markings consisting of waved transverse lines,
and rounded discal and sagittate black markings
near the outer borders. On the under
side of the wings the design of the fore wings
is generally somewhat indistinctly repeated,
and the hind wings are marked more or less
profusely with large silvery spots. In a few
cases there is wide dissimilarity in color between
the male and the female sex; generally
the male sex is marked by the brighter
red of the upper surface, and the female by
the broader black markings, the paler ground-color,
and the sometimes almost white lunules,
which are arranged outwardly at the base of
the sagittate spots along the border.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 89.</a>&mdash;Neuration of
the genus <i>Argynnis</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The eyes are naked; the palpi strongly
developed, heavily clothed with hair rising
above the front, with the last joint very small and pointed. The
antenn&aelig; are moderately long, with a well-defined, flattened club.
The abdomen is shorter than the hind wings; the wings are
more or less denticulate. The subcostal vein is provided with
five nervules, of which the two innermost are invariably given
forth before the end of the cell; the third subcostal nervule
always is nearer the fourth than the second. The cell of the
fore wing is closed by a fine lower discocellular vein, which
invariably joins the median vein beyond the origin of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[ 102]</a></span>
nervule. The hind wing has a well-defined precostal nervule;
the cell in this wing is closed by a moderately thick lower discocellular
vein, which joins the median exactly at the origin of the
second median nervule. The fore feet of the males are slender,
long, and finely clothed with hair. The fore feet of the females
are of the same size as those of the males, but thin, covered with
scales, and only on the inner side of the tibi&aelig; clothed with moderately
long hair.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs are conoidal, truncated, and inwardly depressed
at the apex, rounded at the base, and ornamented on the
sides by parallel raised ridges, not all of which reach the apex.
Between these ridges there are a number of small raised cross-ridges.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is cylindrical, covered with spines,
the first segment always bearing a pair of spines somewhat
longer than the others. All of the species in North America, so
far as their habits are known, feed upon violets at night. During
the daytime the caterpillars lie concealed.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is angular, adorned with more or
less prominent projections. The head is bifid.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Argynnis</i> is one of the largest genera of the brush-footed
butterflies. It is well represented in Europe and in the
temperate regions of Asia, some magnificent species being found
in the Himalayas and in China and Japan. It even extends to
Australia, and recently two species have been discovered in the
vicinity of the great volcanic peak, Kilima-Njaro, in Africa. But
it has found its greatest development upon the continent of North
America. The species composing this genus are among our most
beautiful butterflies. Owing to the fact that there is a great tendency
in many of the forms closely to approximate one another, the
accurate distinction of many of the species has troubled naturalists,
and it is quite probable that some of the so-called species will
ultimately be discovered to be merely local races or varietal forms.
The species that are found in the eastern part of the United States
have been studied very carefully, and their life-history has been
worked out so thoroughly that little difficulty is found in accurately
determining them. The greatest perplexity occurs in connection
with those species which are found in the region of the
Rocky Mountains. While silvery spots are characteristic of the
under side of most of the fritillaries, in some species the silvery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[ 103]</a></span>
spots are not found; in others they are more or less evanescent,
occurring in the case of some individuals, and being absent in the
case of others.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Argynnis idalia</b>, Drury, Plate X, Fig. 3, &#9793;; Plate V,
Fig. 4, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Regal Fritillary).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side of the fore wings of the male is
bright fulvous, marked very much as in other species of the genus.
The upper side of the hind wings is black, glossed with blue,
having a marginal row of fulvous and a submarginal row of
cream-colored spots. On the under side the fore wings are fulvous,
with a marginal row of silver crescents, and some silvery
spots on and near the costa. The hind wings are dark olive-brown,
marked with three rows of large irregular spots of a dull greenish-silvery
color. The female is at once distinguished from the male
by having the marginal row of spots on the hind wings cream-colored,
like the submarginal row, and by the presence of a
similar row of light spots on the fore wings. Expanse, 2.75-4.00
inches.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg in form is like those of other species of
<i>Argynnis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar moults five times before attaining
to maturity. When fully developed it is 1.75 inches long, black,
banded and striped with ochreous and orange-red, and adorned
with six rows of fleshy spines surmounted by several black
bristles. The spines composing the two dorsal rows are white,
tipped with black; those on the sides black, tinted with orange
at the point where they join the body. The caterpillar feeds on
violets, and is nocturnal in its habits.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is brown, mottled with yellow and
tinted on the wing-cases with pinkish. It is about an inch long,
and in outline does not depart from the other species of the genus.</p>

<p>This exceedingly beautiful insect ranges from Maine to Nebraska.
It is found in northern New Jersey, the mountainous
parts of New York and northern Pennsylvania, and is reported
from Arkansas and Nebraska. It is rather local, and frequents
open spots on the borders of woodlands. At times it is apparently
common, and then for a succession of seasons is scarce. It
flies from the end of June to the beginning of September.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Argynnis diana</b>, Cramer, Plate IX, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Fig. 2, &#9793;
(Diana).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[ 104]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side has both wings deep
rich brown, bordered with fulvous, this border being more or
less interrupted by rays of brown along the nervules and two
rows of circular brown spots, larger on the fore wings than on
the hind wings. The wings on the under side are pale buff,
deeply marked with black on the base and middle of the fore
wings, and clouded with grayish-fulvous on the inner two thirds
of the hind wings. A blue spot is located near the end of the
cell in the fore wings, and the hind wings are adorned by a marginal
and submarginal row of narrow silvery crescents and a few
silvery spots toward the base. The female on the upper side is
a rich bluish-black, with the outer border of the fore wings marked
by three rows of bluish-white quadrate spots, the outer row
being the palest, and often quite white. The hind wings are
adorned by three more or less complete rows of bright-blue
spots, the inner row composed of large subquadrate spots, each
having a circular spot of black at its inner extremity. On the
under side the female has the ground-color slaty-brown, paler on
the hind wings than on the fore wings, which latter are richly
marked with blue and black spots. The silvery crescents found
on the under side of the hind wings of the male reappear on the
under side of the female, and are most conspicuous on the outer
margins. Expanse, 3.25-4.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is pale greenish-white, and conformed in outline
to type.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The larva is velvety-black, adorned with six
rows of fleshy spines armed with bristles. The spines are
orange-red at the base. The head is dull brown.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is dusky-brown, with lighter-colored
short projections on the dorsal side.</p>

<p>This splendid butterfly, which is the most magnificent species
of the genus, is confined to the southern portion of the Appalachian
region, occurring in the two Virginias and Carolinas, northern
Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and being occasionally
found in the southern portion of Ohio and Indiana, and in Missouri
and Arkansas.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Argynnis nokomis</b>, Edwards, Plate X, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Fig.
2, &#9793; (Nokomis).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_X">Plate X.</a></span></div>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side is bright fulvous, with
the characteristic black markings of the genus. On the under
side the wings are pale greenish-yellow, with the fore wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[ 105]</a></span>
laved with bright pink at the base and on the inner margin.
The spots of the upper side reappear on the under side as spots
of silver bordered narrowly with black. The female has the
ground-color of the upper side yellow, shaded outwardly with
fulvous. All the dark markings of the male sex reappear in this
sex, but are much broader, and tend to fuse and run into one
another, so as to leave the yellow ground-color as small subquadrate
or circular spots, and wholly to obliterate them at the base
of the wings. On the under side this sex is marked like the male,
but with all the markings broader. Expanse, 3.40-3.60 inches.</p>

<p>This species, the male of which resembles the male of <i>A. leto</i>,
and the female the same sex of <i>A. diana</i>, is as yet quite rare in
collections. It has been taken in Arizona and southern Utah.
We have no knowledge of the life-history of the species.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Argynnis nitocris</b>, Edwards, Plate XIII, Fig. 4, &#9794;, <i>under
side</i> (Nitocris).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male is bright reddish-fulvous, marked like <i>A.
nokomis</i>. The under side of the fore wings is cinnamon-red,
ochre-yellow at the tip. The hind wings are deep rusty-red,
with a broad yellowish-red submarginal belt. The silver spots
are as in <i>A. nokomis</i>. The female on the upper side is blackish-brown,
darker than <i>A. nokomis</i>. The extradiscal spots in the
transverse rows are pale yellow, and the submarginal spots
whitish. The under side of the fore wings is bright red, with
the tip yellow. The hind wings on this side are dark brown, with
a submarginal yellow belt. Expanse, 3.25-3.75 inches.</p>

<p>This species, like the preceding, is from Arizona, and nothing
is known of its egg, caterpillar, or chrysalis.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Argynnis leto</b>, Edwards, Plate IX, Fig. 5, &#9794;; Fig. 6, &#9793;
(Leto).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side is marked much as <i>A.
nokomis</i>, but the ground-color is duller red, and the basal area is
much darker. The under side of the fore wings is pale fulvous,
upon which the markings of the upper side reappear; but there are
no marginal silver crescents. Both wings on the under side are
shaded with brown toward the base; the hind wings are traversed
by a submarginal band of light straw-yellow. The female
is marked as the male, but the ground-color is pale straw-yellow,
and all the darker markings are deep blackish-brown, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[ 106]</a></span>
at the base of both wings being broad and running into one another,
so that the inner half of the wings appears to be broadly
brownish-black. On the under side this sex is marked as the
male, but with the dark portions blacker and the lighter portions
pale yellow. Expanse, 2.50-3.25 inches.</p>

<p>The life-history of this insect remains to be worked out. It is
one of our most beautiful species, and occurs in California and
Oregon.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Argynnis cybele</b>, Fabricius, Plate IX, Fig. 3, &#9794;; Fig. 4,
&#9793;; Plate XIII, Fig. 1, &#9793;, under side; Plate V, Figs. 1-3, <i>chrysalis</i>
(The Great Spangled Fritillary).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male is much like the male of <i>A. leto</i>, but the
dark markings of the upper surface are heavier, and the under
sides of the hind wings are more heavily silvered. The yellowish-buff
submarginal band on the under side of the hind wings is
never obliterated by being invaded by the darker ferruginous of
the marginal and discal tracts of the wing. The female has the
ground-color of the wings paler than the male, and both wings
from the base to the angled median band on the upper side are
dark chocolate-brown. All the markings of the upper side in
this sex are heavier than in the male. On the under side the female
is like the male. Expanse, 3.00-4.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Short, conoidal, ribbed like those of other species, and
honey-yellow.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The larva in the mature state is black. The head
is blackish, shaded with chestnut behind. The body is ornamented
with six rows of shining black branching spines, generally
marked with orange-red at their base. The caterpillar,
which is nocturnal, feeds on violets, hibernating immediately
after being hatched from the egg, and feeding to maturity in the
following spring.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>-The chrysalis is dark brown, mottled with reddish-brown
or slaty-gray.</p>

<p>This species, which ranges over the Atlantic States and the
valley of the Mississippi as far as the plains of Nebraska, appears
to be single-brooded in the North and double-brooded in Virginia,
the Carolinas, and the Western States having the same
geographical latitude. A small variety of this species, called <i>A.
carpenteri</i> by Mr. W.H. Edwards, is found in New Mexico
upon the top of Taos Peak, and is believed to be isolated here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[ 107]</a></span>
a colony, as <i>&OElig;neis semidea</i> is isolated upon the summit of Mount
Washington. Specimens of <i>cybele</i> much like those of this New
Mexican variety are found in eastern Maine and Nova Scotia, and
on the high mountains of North Carolina.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Argynnis aphrodite</b>, Fabricius, Plate XIV, Fig. 11, &#9793;,
<i>under side</i>; Plate V, Fig. 5, <i>chrysalis</i> (Aphrodite).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species closely resembles <i>cybele</i>, but is generally
smaller, and the yellow submarginal band on the hind
wings is narrower than in <i>cybele</i>, and often wholly wanting, the
hind wings being broadly brown, particularly in the female sex.
The under side of the fore wings at the base and on the inner
margin is also brighter red.</p>

<p>The caterpillar, chrysalis, and egg of this species closely resemble
those of <i>cybele</i>. The caterpillar has, however, a velvety-black
spot at the base of each spine, the chrysalis has the
tubercles on the back shorter than in <i>cybele</i>, and the basal segments
are party-colored, and not uniformly colored as in <i>cybele</i>.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Argynnis cipris</b>, Edwards, Plate XII, Fig. 3, &#9794;; Fig. 4,
&#9793; (The New Mexican Silver-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species, which belongs to the Aphrodite-group,
may be distinguished by the fact that the fore wings are
relatively longer and narrower than in <i>aphrodite</i>. The black
markings on the upper side of the wings in both sexes are narrower,
the dusky clouding at the base of the wings is less pronounced,
and the ground-color is brighter reddish-fulvous than
in <i>aphrodite</i>. On the under side the fore wings lack in the
male the pinkish shade at the base and on the inner margin
which appears in <i>aphrodite</i>, and both the male and the female
have the inner two thirds of the hind wings deep cinnamon-red,
with only a very narrow buff submarginal band, deeply invaded
on the side of the base by rays of the deeper brown color of the
inner portion of the wing. Expanse, 2.75-3.15 inches. The
insect flies from late June to the end of August.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar, etc.</i>&mdash;We know nothing of the larval stages of
this insect. The specimens contained in the Edwards collection
came from Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico, and these localities
approximately represent the range of the species.</p>

<p>(9) <b>Argynnis alcestis</b>, Edwards, Plate X, Fig. 6, &#9794;, <i>under
side</i> (The Ruddy Silver-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Very much like <i>aphrodite</i>, from which it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[ 108]</a></span>
most easily distinguished by the fact that the hind wings are
uniformly dark cinnamon-brown, without any band of buff on
the outer margin. Expanse, 2.50-3.00 inches. The insect flies
from late June to the end of August.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Greenish, conoidal, with about eighteen vertical ribs.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;Head black, yellowish behind. The body velvety-black,
ornamented with black spines which are yellowish at
their basal ends. The caterpillar feeds on violets.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;Reddish-brown or gray, irregularly mottled and
striped with black, the abdominal segments slaty-gray, marked
with black on the edges where the short angular projections are
located.</p>

<p>This butterfly is found in the Western States, extending from
the prairie lands of northwestern Ohio to Montana. It largely
replaces <i>aphrodite</i> in these regions.</p>

<p>(10) <b>Argynnis nausica&auml;</b>, Edwards, Plate XI, Fig. 9, &#9794; (The
Arizona Silver-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The species is related to the foregoing, but is
rather smaller in size. The upper side of the wings is dusky
reddish-brown, with the characteristic markings of the genus.
On the under side the fore wings are pink, laved with buff at the
tip. The hind wings on this side are deep cinnamon-brown,
mottled with buff on the inner two thirds; a narrow but clearly
defined submarginal band of bright yellowish-buff surrounds
them. The silvery spots are clearly marked. The female has the
black markings broader and more conspicuous than the male.
Expanse, 2.25-2.50 inches.</p>

<p>This insect is quite common in the mountain valleys of Arizona,
at an elevation of from six to seven thousand feet above
the level of the sea, and flies in July and August. We have no
knowledge of the early stages, but it probably does not differ
greatly in its larval state from the allied species of the genus.</p>

<p>(11)<b>Argynnis atlantis</b>, Edwards, Plate X, Fig. 9, &#9794;; Plate
V, Fig. 6, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Mountain Silver-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This insect, which resembles <i>aphrodite</i>, is distinguished
from that species by its smaller size, its somewhat narrower
wings, the deeper brown color of the base of the wings on
the upper side, and their darker color on the under side. The
submarginal band is pale yellow, narrow, but distinct and always
present. Expanse, 2.50 inches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI.</a></span></div>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Conoidal, with twelve to fourteen ribs, honey-yellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[ 109]</a></span>
The caterpillars are hatched in the fall, and hibernate without feeding
until the following spring.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The head is dark blackish-brown. The body
is velvety-purple above, a little paler on the under side. The
usual spines occur on the body, and are black, grayish at the
base. The larva feeds on violets.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is light brown, speckled, except on
the abdominal segments, with black.</p>

<p>This species ranges from Maine to the mountains of western
Pennsylvania, and thence southward along the central ridges of
the Alleghanies into West Virginia. It is also found in Canada,
and extends westward into the region of the Rocky Mountains.
It is especially common in the White Mountains of New Hampshire
and the Adirondacks.</p>

<p>(12) <b>Argynnis lais</b>, Edwards, Plate XIV, Fig. 12, &#9794;; Fig.
13, &#9793; (The Northwestern Silver-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male is bright reddish-fulvous on the upper
side, slightly obscured by fuscous at the base. The discal band
of spots common to both wings is broken and irregular, and the
spots on the hind wings are quite small. The fore wings on the
under side are buff at the tips and pale red at the base and on
the inner margin, lighter at the inner angle. The under side of
the hind wings as far as the outer margin of the discal row of
silvery spots is dark brown, mottling a yellowish ground. The
submarginal band of the hind wings is pale yellow and moderately
broad. The female is marked much as the male, but the
discal band of spots on the upper side of the fore wings is confluent
and broader, the fringes whitish, and the spots included
between the sagittate marginal spots and the marginal lines paler
than in the male sex. Expanse, 2.00-2.20 inches.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar, etc.</i>&mdash;The early stages are unknown.</p>

<p>This species is found in the territories of Alberta and Assiniboia,
and in British Columbia among the foot-hills and the lower
slopes of the mountain-ranges.</p>

<p>(13) <b>Argynnis oweni</b>, Edwards, Plate XII, Fig. 5, &#9794;; Fig.
6, &#9793;, <i>under side</i> (Owen's Silver-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The wings on the upper side are dull reddish-fulvous,
not much obscured with brown on the base, the black
markings moderately heavy, the two marginal lines tending to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[ 110]</a></span>
flow together. The fore wings on the under side are yellowish-buff
from the base to the outer row of spots, or in some specimens
with the buff lightly laved with reddish; the nerves reddish-brown.
The subapical patch is dark brown, with a small silvered
spot; the five submarginal spots are small and obscurely
silvered. The hind wings are dark brown on the discal area
and outer margin, with a rather narrow grayish-buff submarginal
band, strongly invaded by projections of the dark brown of the
discal area. The spots of the outer discal row are generally well
silvered; the inner spots less so in most cases.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female has the wings more or less mottled with
yellowish outside of the mesial band. The black markings are
very heavy in this sex. On the under side the spots are well
silvered.</p>

<p>The dark markings on the upper side of the wings of the male
are much heavier than in <i>A. behrensi</i>. On the under side of the
wings in both sexes it may be distinguished from <i>behrensi</i> by
the fact that the ground-color toward the base is mottled with
yellow, and not solid brown as in <i>behrensi</i>. Expanse, 2.25-2.40
inches.</p>

<p>This species abounds on Mount Shasta, in California, at an
elevation of seven to eight thousand feet above sea-level.</p>

<p>(14) <b>Argynnis cornelia</b>, Edwards. Plate XI, Fig. 8, &#9794;
(Miss Owen's Fritillary).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The upper side of both wings is dark brown
from the base to the mesial band of spots, with the exception of
the outer end of the cell. The space beyond the band is reddish-fulvous;
the dark markings are not very heavy; the two marginal
lines are fine, and confluent at the ends of the nervules.
The under side of the fore wings is reddish-brown from the base
to the outer margin on the inner half of the wing; the outer
spaces toward the apex are yellowish; the subapical patch is
reddish-brown, inclosing a small silvery spot; the outer margin
is reddish-brown, adorned with five small silvery spots toward
the apex. The hind wings on the under side are almost solid
reddish-brown to the clear yellow submarginal belt, only slightly
mottled on the discal area with buff. The spots are small and
well silvered.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female on the upper side is duller red, with the dark
markings heavier; the marginal spots on the fore wings are pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[ 111]</a></span>
yellowish, and the marginal lines are confluent on the upper half
of these wings. The wings on the under side in this sex are as
in the male, but the ground-color on the inner half of the wings
is darker, and the spots are more brilliantly silvered. Expanse,
2.30-2.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This pretty species is found with <i>A. electa</i> and <i>A. hesperis</i> in
Colorado. It was originally described from specimens taken at
Manitou and Ouray, and named by Edwards in honor of a deceased
daughter of Professor Owen of the University of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>(15) <b>Argynnis electa</b>, Edwards, Plate X, Fig. 8, &#9794; (Electa).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male is dull reddish-fulvous on the upper
side. The black markings are narrow. The base of both wings
is slightly obscured. On the under side the fore wings are pale
cinnamon-red, with the tip dark cinnamon-red. The hind wings are
broadly dark cinnamon-red, mottled on the disk with a little buff.
The submarginal band is buff, quite narrow, and often invaded
by the ground-color of the inner area. The silvery spots are
usually very well marked and distinct, though in a few instances
the silvery color is somewhat obscured. The female has the
black markings a little heavier than in the male; otherwise there
is but little difference between the sexes. Expanse, 2.00-2.25
inches.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar, etc.</i>&mdash;The early stages are unknown.</p>

<p>This species has been confounded with <i>A. atlantis</i>, from
which it is wholly distinct, being much smaller in size, the fore
wings relatively broader, and the markings not so dark on the
upper surface. It is found in Colorado and Montana, among the
mountains.</p>

<p>(16) <b>Argynnis columbia</b>, Henry Edwards, Plate XIV, Fig. 3,
&#9794; (The Columbian Silver-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male has the upper side of the fore wings pale
reddish-fulvous. In the median band of both wings the spots do
not flow together, but are separate and moderately heavy. The
under side of the fore wings is pale fulvous, buff at the tip; spots
silvered. The hind wings on the under side are light rusty-red,
but little mottled with buff on the disk; the submarginal band is
narrow, buff, and sometimes almost wholly obscured by the darker
ground-color. The spots, which are small, are well silvered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[ 112]</a></span>
The female is much lighter than the male, and, as usual, the dark
lines are heavier than in that sex. The spots of the median band
are bent and partly lanceolate, and the light spots of the outer
border are whitish. Expanse, 2.25-2.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar, etc.</i>&mdash;The early stages have not as yet been
worked out.</p>

<p>This species, which is related to <i>electa</i>, may easily be distinguished
from it by the pale marginal series of light spots, in the
male, between the sagittate spots and the dark outer marginal
lines, which latter are confluent, forming a solid dark outer border
to the wing, while in <i>electa</i> they are separated by a narrow
band of light-brown spots. The female is also much lighter and
larger than in <i>electa</i>, as has been pointed out. The types which
came from the Caribou mining region of British Columbia are in
my possession, as are those of most of the other North American
species of the genus.</p>

<p>(17) <b>Argynnis hesperis</b>, Edwards, Plate XII, Fig. 1, &#9794;;
Fig. 2, &#9793; (Hesperis).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side of the wings is fulvous,
shaded with dark fuscous for a short distance from the
base. The black spots of the median band are rather broad, and
seem to coalesce through dark markings along the nervules.
The under side of the fore wings is pale ferruginous, tinged with
a little buff at the tips, which, together with the outer margin, are
somewhat heavily clouded with dark ferruginous. The under
side of the hind wings is dark ferruginous, with a narrow buff
submarginal band, which in some specimens is almost lost.
The female is paler than the male in the ground-color of the
upper side, the black markings are heavier, the marginal lines fuse,
as do also the sagittate marginal markings, leaving the marginal
spots between them, which are quite light in color, deeply bordered
on all sides by black. The under side is like that of the
male, but darker and richer in color. In neither sex are the light
spots marked with silver; they are opaque, yellowish-white.
Expanse, 2.25-2.40 inches.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar, etc.</i>&mdash;The life-history remains to be learned.</p>

<p>This insect is not uncommon among the mountains of Colorado.</p>

dark markings being heavy and black, and the basal areas of the
wings clouded with fuscous, this dark clouding on the hind
wings reaching down and nearly covering the inner angle. The
fore wings on the under side are buff, laved with pale red at the
base, marked with ferruginous on the outer margin and about
the subapical spots. The submarginal and subapical spots are
silvered, especially the latter. The hind wings are deep ferruginous,
mottled with buff. The submarginal band is buff, narrow,
and dusted with more or less ferruginous. All the spots are well
silvered. The female has the basal area of the fore wings bright
pinkish-fulvous, and the belt of the secondaries almost lost in the
deep ground-color.</p>

<p>(19) <b>Argynnis bremneri</b>, Edwards, Plate X, Fig. 7, &#9794;

black markings, especially those about the middle of the wing,
are heavy. Both wings at the base are clouded with fuscous,
the under side of the primaries red toward the base, buff on the
apical area; the subapical and the upper marginal spots well
silvered; the hind wings with the inner two thirds more or less
deeply ferruginous, a little mottled with buff, very rarely encroached
upon by the dark color of the inner area, except occasionally
near the anal angle. Expanse, &#9794;, 2.40 inches; &#9793;, 2.70

with rather heavy black markings, the mesial band of spots being
confluent. The under side of the fore wings is reddish, inclining
to pink, with the apex laved with buff. The hind wings have
the ground-color purplish-gray, mottled on the inner two thirds
with ferruginous. The spots are not silvered, but are a delicate
gray color. The female is colored like the male, but the red at
the base of the fore wings in this sex is much deeper, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[ 114]</a></span>
yellow at the apex of the primaries contrasts much more strongly.
The spots on the under side in the female sex are frequently well
silvered, though in many specimens they are colored exactly as
in the male sex. Expanse of wing, &#9794;, 2.17 inches; &#9793;, 2.50
inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The early stages of this species have not as
yet been ascertained.</p>

<p>This beautiful butterfly, which is somewhat inclined to variation,
is found in northern California, being quite common about
Mount Shasta. It is also found in Oregon and Nevada. One
of the varietal forms was named <i>Argynnis purpurescens</i> by the
late Henry Edwards, because of the decided purplish tint which
prevails on the under side of the secondaries, extending over the
entire surface of the hind wings and covering likewise the apex
of the fore wings. This purplish-brown is very marked in specimens
collected about the town of Soda Springs, in northern
California.</p>

<p>(21) <b>Argynnis monticola</b>, Behr, Plate XIII, Fig. 7, &#9794;, <i>under
side</i>; Fig. 8, &#9794;; Plate XIV, Fig. 17, &#9793; (Behr's Fritillary).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is very closely allied to the preceding
in some respects; the upper surface, however, of the wings
in both sexes is brighter than in <i>zerene</i>, and the dark markings
stand forth more clearly upon the lighter ground-color. The
wings are not shaded with fuscous toward the base as much as
in <i>A. zerene.</i> While the markings on the upper side are almost
identical with those of Dr. Boisduval's species, they are much
brighter and clearer, giving the insects quite a different aspect.
On the under side the wings are colored as in <i>zerene</i>, the primaries
in the male being ferruginous, laved with a little red toward
the base, marked with purplish-gray toward the apex, the light
spots near the end of the cell on this wing being pale buff. The
hind wings are very uniformly purplish-gray, mottled with dark
brown, the spots very little, if at all, silvered in the male. In the
female the fore wings are bright red at the base, and the hind
wings are colored as in the male; but all the spots in both the
fore wings and hind wings are broadly and brightly silvered.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The early stages have not been ascertained,
and there remains something here for young entomologists to
accomplish.</p>

<p>This species is quite common in the same localities as the last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[ 115]</a></span>
and some authors are inclined to regard it as being a mere variety,
which is a belief that can only be verified by careful breeding
from the egg.</p>

<p>(22) <b>Argynnis rhodope</b>, Edwards, Plate XI, Fig. 6, &#9793;, <i>under
side</i> (Rhodope).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;In the male sex the upper side is bright fulvous,
with both wings on the inner half heavily clouded with dark fuscous.
The black markings are very heavy and confluent. The outer
border is solid black, very slightly, if at all, interrupted by a narrow
marginal brown line, in this respect resembling <i>A. atlantis.</i>
On the under side the fore wings are dark ferruginous, on the
outer margin rich dark brown. Between the spots at the end
of the cell and the nervules below the apex are some clear, bright
straw-yellow spots. The upper spots of the marginal series are
silvered. The hind wings are dark reddish-brown, very slightly
paler on the line of the marginal band. The spots are pale straw-yellow,
except those of the marginal series, which are distinctly
silvered. The female on the upper side is of a lighter and
brighter red, with the markings dark and heavy as in the male
sex. On the under side the markings in the female do not differ
from those in the male, except that the primaries on the inner
half and at the base are bright pinkish-red. Expanse, &#9794;, 2.20
inches; &#9793;, 2.40 inches.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side is dull fulvous,
clouded with fuscous at the base, the black markings much narrower
and lighter than in the preceding species. The primaries
on the under side are pale fulvous, clouded with dark brown at
the apex. The subapical spots and the upper spots of the marginal
series on this wing are well silvered. The hind wings on
the under side are deep reddish-brown, with the marginal band
only faintly indicated. All the spots are distinctly well silvered.
The female does not differ materially from the male, except in the
larger size and the somewhat paler ground-color of the upper side
of the wings. On the under side the wings are exactly as in the
male, with the marginal band even less distinct than in that sex.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The primaries are produced and relatively
narrower than in the preceding species, fulvous on the upper
side, with the black markings distinct, the mesial band of the
secondaries confluent. The fore wings on the under side are
pale fulvous, reddish at the base, pale buff at the end of the cell
and on the costal margin before the apex. The subapical spots
and the pale spots of the marginal series are very little silvered.
The hind wings have the inner two thirds deep reddish-brown,
slightly mottled with buff. The marginal band is buff, and all
the spots are well silvered.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female, which is considerably larger than the male,
is marked much as in that sex; but all the black markings are
heavier, and on the under side of the primaries the base and inner
margin are laved with red. The marginal band on the hind
wings is not as distinct in this sex as in the male, in many specimens
being somewhat obscured by olive-brown. Expanse, &#9794;,

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The wings on the upper side are light tawny,
but little obscured by fuscous at the base. The black markings
are moderately heavy and very sharply defined against the
lighter ground-color. The outer margin is distinctly but not
heavily marked. On the under side of the fore wings there are
two subapical and five marginal silver spots. The ground-color
of the under side of the hind wings is grayish-green, with a narrow

<p><i>Butterfly,</i>.&mdash;This species may easily be recognized by the
general obscuration of the basal area of the wings, the light-buff
quadrate spots on the discal area of the fore wings, and the
clear oval spots of the same color on the hind wings, as well as
by the light triangular marginal spots, all standing out distinctly

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species, which apparently belongs to the
Eurynome-group, appears by the location of its markings to be
closely related to <i>eurynome</i>, but on the upper side the wings of
both the male and female are more heavily obscured with fuscous

<p><i>A. eurynome</i> is a very common butterfly in Colorado, Montana,

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species in both sexes very closely approximates
the foregoing. The main points of distinction consist in
the somewhat darker red of the upper side of the wings, the
slightly heavier dark markings, and the absence on the under
side, especially of the hind wings, of the olive-green shade
which is characteristic of typical specimens of <i>A. eurynome.</i>
The mottling of the basal and median areas on this side is reddish-brown.
The spots are more or less silvered on the under

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The ground-color of the wings on the upper
side is deep fulvous, with rather heavy black markings. The
wings on the under side are pale fulvous, mottled with buff on
the subapical interspaces of the fore wings. The basal and discal
areas of the hind wings are mottled with brown, which in many
specimens is of a distinctly purplish shade. In some specimens
the inner half of the primaries is rather heavily laved with red.
The spots on the under side are either silvered or without silver,
in the latter case being pale buff.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female is much like the male, but paler. The red
on the under side of the primaries is deeper, and the purplish-brown
on the inner surface of the secondaries is also darker.
Expanse, &#9794;, 2.25 inches; &#9793;, 2.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These remain to be ascertained.</p>

<p>This is a common species in California and Nevada. For
many years it has been placed in all catalogues at the end of the
list of the species of this genus, where I also leave it, though to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[ 127]</a></span>
my way of thinking its proper location is near <i>A. rupestris</i>. It
certainly reveals but small affinity to the species of the Eurynome group.</p>

<p>Besides the species of <i>Argynnis</i> enumerated in the foregoing
pages and delineated upon the plates, there are several others of
more or less doubtful validity credited to our fauna, and a number
of varieties which have received names. With all of these
the more advanced student will become familiar as he prosecutes
his researches, but it is not necessary to speak of them here.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>A RACE AFTER A BUTTERFLY</b></p>

<p>There is much that is pleasing about "first things." I shall
never forget the first dollar I earned; the first trout I took with
my fly; the first muskalonge I gaffed beside my canoe on a still
Canadian lake; the first voyage I made across the Atlantic. So I
shall never forget my first capture of a female specimen of <i>Argynnis
diana</i>.</p>

<p>My home in my boyhood was in North Carolina, in the village
of Salem, famous as one of the most successful of the settlements
made by the Moravian Brethren under the lead of the good Count
Zinzendorf, and well known throughout the Southern States as
the seat of an excellent seminary for young ladies. The Civil War
broke out, and the hopes cherished of sending me North to be
educated were disappointed. I was left to pursue my studies
under a tutor, and to roam the neighborhood in quest of insects,
of which I gathered a large collection.</p>

<p>One day I spied upon a bed of verbenas a magnificent butterfly
with broad expanse of wing and large blue spots upon the secondaries.
In breathless haste I rushed into the house and got my
net. To the joy of my heart, when I returned to the spot, the
beauty was still hovering over the crimson blossoms. But, as I
drew near with fell intent, it rose and sailed away. Across the
garden, over the fence, across the churchyard, out into the
street, with leisurely flight the coveted prize sped its way, while
I quickly followed, net in hand. Once upon the dusty street, its
flight was accelerated; my rapid walking was converted into a
run. Down past the church and&mdash;<i>horribile dictu!</i>&mdash;past the
boarding-school that pesky butterfly flew. I would rather have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[ 128]</a></span>
faced a cannonade in those days than a bevy of boarding-school
misses, but there was no alternative. There were the dreaded
females at the windows (for it was Saturday, and vacation hour),
and there was my butterfly. Sweating, blushing, inwardly
anathematizing my luck, I rushed past the school, only to be
overwhelmed with mortification by the rascally porter of the
institution, who was sweeping the pavement, and who bawled
out after me: "Oh, it's no use; you can't catch it! It's frightened;
you're so ugly!" And now it began to rise in its flight.
It was plainly my last chance, for it would in a moment be lost
over the housetops. I made an upward leap, and by a fortunate
sweep of the net succeeded in capturing my prize.</p>

<p>Many years later, after a long interval in which ornithology
and botany had engrossed my mind to the exclusion of entomology,
my boyish love for the butterflies was renewed, and I
found out the name of the choice thing I had captured on that hot
July day on the streets of Salem, and returned to North Carolina
for the special purpose of collecting a quantity of these superb insects.
My quest was entirely successful, though my specimens
were not taken at Salem, but under the shadow of Mount
Mitchell, in the flower-spangled valleys which lie at its feet.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>-Small or medium-sized butterflies, very closely approximating
in form and color the species of the genus <i>Argynnis</i>,
in which they are included by many writers. The principal
structural difference between the two genera is found in the fact
that in the genus <i>Brenthis</i> only one of the subcostal nervules
arises before or at the end of the cell of the primaries, while in
<i>Argynnis</i> the two innermost subcostal nervules thus arise. In
<i>Brenthis</i> the palpi are not as stout as in <i>Argynnis</i>, and the short
basal spur or branch of the median vein of the front wings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[ 129]</a></span>
which is characteristic of the latter genus, is altogether lacking
in <i>Brenthis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs are subconical, almost twice
as high as wide, truncated at the top, and
marked with thirteen or fourteen raised longitudinal
ridges connected by a multitude of
smaller cross-ridges.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&mdash;The caterpillars are not noticeably
different in their general appearance from those
of the genus <i>Argynnis</i>, except that they are
smaller and generally not as dark in color as
the larv&aelig; of the latter genus. They feed, like
the caterpillars of <i>Argynnis</i>, upon violets.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is pendant, about
six tenths of an inch long, and armed with
two rows of sharp conical tubercles on the
back.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar has been carefully studied, and
its various stages are fully described in "The Butterflies of New

eighths of an inch long, dark olive-brown, marked with green,
the segments being adorned with fleshy tubercles armed with
needle-shaped projections, the tubercles on the side of the first
thoracic segment being four times as long as the others, cylindrical
in form, and blunt at the upper end, the spines projecting
upward at an angle of forty-five degrees to the axis of the tubercle.</p>

base of the fore wings and the inner margin of the hind wings
heavily obscured with blackish scales. The usual dark markings
are finer than in the preceding species; the black marginal borders
are not so heavy. The submarginal spots are relatively large and
distinct in most specimens, and uniform in size. The light spots
of the under side of the median band of the hind wings show
through from below on the upper side lighter than the ground-color
of the wings. On the under side the fore wings are fulvous,
tipped with ferruginous. The hind wings are broadly ferruginous,
with a couple of bright-yellow spots near the base and a
curved band of yellow spots crossing the median area. The
outer margin about the middle is marked with pale fulvous.
The spots on the under side are none of them silvered.</p>

and the marginal spots within the lunules are very pale, almost
white. The submarginal row of round black spots is relatively
large and distinct, quite uniform in size. On the under side the
wings are much more conspicuously marked on the secondaries
than in the male sex, being crossed by three conspicuous bands
of irregularly shaped yellow spots, one at the base and one on
either side of the discal area. The submarginal round spots of
the upper side reappear on the under side as small, slightly
silvered, yellow spots. The marginal spots are bright yellow,
slightly glossed with silver. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50 inch; &#9793;, 1.60 inch.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The wings on the upper side are fulvous,
greatly obscured by brown at the base of the fore wings and
along the inner margin of the hind wings. The usual black
markings are light, and the marginal border is also not so heavily
marked as in <i>B. myrina</i>. The fore wings on the under side are
pale fulvous, laved with ferruginous at the tip. The hind wings
are brightly ferruginous, with small yellow marginal spots, and
paler spots inclining to buff on the costal border and at the end
of the cell, about the region of the median nervules.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female is very much like the male on the upper
side, but the ground-color is paler. On the under side the
wings are somewhat paler, and all the spots and light markings,
especially on the secondaries, are far more conspicuous, being
bright yellow, and standing out very prominently upon the dark
ferruginous ground. Expanse, 1.40 inch.</p>

<p>This interesting butterfly is found on the barren summits of
Mount Washington, New Hampshire. It represents the survival
of the arctic fauna on these desolate peaks, and, like the arctic
flora of the spot where it is found, is a souvenir of the ice-age,

<p>(5) <b>Brenthis chariclea</b>, Schneider, Plate XV, Fig. 4, &#9794;
(Chariclea).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;Fulvous on the upper side, with heavy black
markings, both wings greatly obscured at the base by fuscous.
On the under side the fore wings are pale yellowish-fulvous,
mottled with ferruginous at the tip and on the outer margin.
The hind wings on the under side are dark purplish-ferruginous,
mottled with yellow, crossed by a central row of conspicuous
yellow spots. The row of marginal spots and two or three small
spots at the base are white, slightly silvered.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female differs from the male in having the markings
of the upper side darker and heavier, and the outer margins more
heavily marked with black, and having all the spots on the under
side more distinctly defined against the dark ground. Expanse,
&#9794;, 1.50 inch; &#9793;, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Undescribed.</p>

<p>This species, like <i>B. freija</i>, is circumpolar, being found in Lapland,
Greenland, and throughout arctic America. It also occurs
within the limits of the United States, in the Yellowstone Park at
considerable elevations, and is not uncommon on the high mountains
in British Columbia, numerous specimens having been captured
in recent years about Banff and Laggan, in Alberta.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Brenthis boisduvali</b>, Duponchel, Plate XV, Fig. 5. &#9794;;
Fig. 6, &#9793;, <i>under side</i> (Boisduval's Fritillary).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Somewhat closely resembling <i>B. chariclea</i>, but
with the markings much heavier on the outer margin, and the
base of the wings generally more deeply obscured with dark
brown. The wings on the under side in color and marking
closely approximate those of <i>B. chariclea</i>, and I have been unable
to distinguish the specimens marked as <i>boisduvali</i>, and contained
in the Edwards collection, from the specimens designated as <i>B. chariclea</i>
in the same collection, so far as the color and maculation
of the under sides of these specimens are concerned. Expanse,
&#9794;, 1.50 inch; &#9793;, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This species, originally described from Labrador, is found
throughout boreal America and British Columbia.</p>

base and the hind wings on the inner half being deeply obscured
with fuscous. The markings are quite heavy. The fore wings
on the under side are very pale fulvous, yellowish at the tip,
mottled with ferruginous. The hind wings are ferruginous on
the under side, mottled with yellow. The spots are quite large,
consisting of lines and dashes, and a marginal row of small lunulate
spots, pale yellow or white, slightly silvered. Expanse,
1.50 inch.</p>

<p>This butterfly is circumpolar, being found in Norway, Lapland,
northern Russia, and Siberia, through Alaska, British
America, and Labrador, occurring also upon the highest peaks
of the Rocky Mountains as far south as Colorado.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Brenthis polaris</b>, Boisduval, Plate XV, Fig. 11, &#9794;;
Fig. 12, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (The Polar Fritillary).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side dull fulvous; the markings on the
inner half of the wings are confluent, and lost in the brownish
vestiture which obscures this portion of the wing. The outer
median area is defined by irregular zigzag spots which flow together.
Beyond these the submarginal row of small black spots
stands out distinctly upon the lighter ground-color of the wings.
The outer margin is marked by black spots at the end of the
nervules, on the fore wings somewhat widely separated, on the
hind wings narrowly separated by the lighter ground-color. On
the under side the wings are fulvous, with a marginal row of
white checkerings on both wings. The hind wing is deeply
mottled with ferruginous, on which the lighter white markings
stand forth very conspicuously. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50 inch.; &#9793;,
1.50-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This butterfly has been found in Labrador, Greenland, and
other portions of arctic America, as far north as latitude 81&#176; 52&acute;.</p>

<p>(9) <b>Brenthis frigga</b>, Thunberg, Plate XV, Fig. 13, &#9794;; Fig.
14, &#9793;, <i>lower side</i> (Frigga).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;On the upper side this butterfly somewhat
closely resembles <i>polaris</i>, but the markings are not so compact&mdash;more
diffuse. The fore wings at the base and the hind wings
on the inner two thirds are heavily obscured with brown. The
outer margins are more heavily shaded with blackish-brown than
in <i>B. polaris</i>. On the under side the wings are quite differently
marked. The fore wings are fulvous, shaded with brown at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[ 134]</a></span>
tips, and marked with light yellow on the interspaces beyond
the end of the cell. The hind wings are dark ferruginous, shading
into purplish-gray on the outer margin, with a whitish quadrate
spot on the costa near the base, marked with two dark
spots, and a bar of pale, somewhat obscured spots, forming an
irregular band across the middle of the hind wings.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female does not differ greatly from the male, except
that the spots on the under side of the hind wings stand forth
more conspicuously, being lighter in color and better defined.
Expanse, 1.65-2.00 inches.</p>

<p>This pretty little butterfly occurs in Labrador, across the continent
as far west as northern Alaska, and is also occasionally
taken upon the alpine summits of the Rocky Mountains as far
south as Colorado.</p>

<p>(10) <b>Brenthis bellona</b>, Fabricius, Plate XV, Fig. 16, &#9794;; Plate
V, Fig. 10, <i>chrysalis, side view</i>; Fig. 11, <i>chrysalis, side view</i>
(Meadow Fritillary).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Pale fulvous on the upper side, with the dark
markings on the inner half of the wing narrow, but more or less
confluent. The dark markings on the outer part of the wing are
slighter. The fore wings are a little angled on the outer margin
below the apex. On the under side the fore wings are pale fulvous,
mottled with purple at the tip and on the outer margin.
The hind wings on this side are ferruginous, mottled with
purple. Expanse, 1.65-1.80 inch.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg of this species is similar in form, size, color,
and markings to the egg of <i>B. myrina</i>.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar also in its early stages closely resembles
<i>myrina</i>, but in its mature form it differs in not having the
spines on the second segment of the body lengthened as in that
species.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis, which is represented in Plate V, is
bluish-gray in color, marked with dark spots. The life-history
has been given us by several authors.</p>

<p>This butterfly is very common in the whole of the northern
United States, as far south as the mountain-ranges of Virginia,
and occurs throughout Quebec, Ontario, and British America, as
far west as the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains. It flies commonly
with <i>B. myrina</i>, the only other species of the genus found in the
densely populated portions of our territory, from which it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[ 135]</a></span>
at once distinguished by the entire absence of the silvered markings
which make <i>B. myrina</i> so bright and attractive.</p>

<p>(11) <b>Brenthis epithore</b>, Boisduval, Plate XV, Fig. 17, &#9794;;
Fig. 18, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (Epithore).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species on the upper side is pale fulvous, with
the markings slighter than in <i>B. bellona</i>, and the inner half of the
hind wings much more heavily clouded with fuscous. On the
under side the wings are somewhat like those of <i>B. bellona</i>, but
less purple and mottled more distinctly with yellow. Expanse,
&#9794;, 1.50 inch; &#9793;, 1.85 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Undescribed.</p>

<p>This species appears to replace <i>B. bellona</i>, its close ally, in
California, Oregon, and the States eastward as far as parts of
Colorado.</p>

<p>(12) <b>Brenthis alberta</b>, Edwards, Plate XV, Fig. 15, &#9794; (Alberta).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This, the least attractive in appearance of the
species composing the genus, has pale wings with a "washed-out"
appearance on the upper side, almost all the dark markings
being greatly reduced or obliterated. On the under side the wings
are even more obscurely marked than on the upper side. The female
is darker than the male, and specimens have a greasy look.
Expanse, &#9794;, 1.55 inch; &#9793;, 1.65-1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown, except the egg and the young
caterpillar, which have been most beautifully figured by Edwards
in vol. iii of "The Butterflies of North America." The only
locality from which specimens have as yet been received by collectors
is Laggan, in Alberta, where the species apparently is not
uncommon at lofty elevations above sea-level.</p>

<p>(13) <b>Brenthis astarte</b>, Doubleday and Hewitson, Plate XVIII,
Fig. 14, &#9794;; Fig. 15, &#9793;, <i>under side</i> (Astarte).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This rare insect, the largest of the genus, may at
once be distinguished from all others by the very beautiful markings
of the under side of the hind wings, crossed by a band of
irregular, bright-yellow spots, which are narrowly edged with
black, and beyond the black bordered by red. Expanse, &#9794;, 2.00
inches; &#9793;, 2.15 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The first description and figure of this insect were given by
Doubleday and Hewitson in their large and now very valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[ 136]</a></span>
work on "The Genera of Diurnal Lepidoptera." They correctly
attributed it to the Rocky Mountains, but Kirby afterward
gave Jamaica as its habitat, and this led to its subsequent redescription
by Edwards under the name <i>Victoria</i>. It is a rare species
still, having been received only from Laggan, Alberta, where it
was rediscovered by that most indefatigable collector and observer,
Mr. T.E. Bean. It frequents the highest summits
of the lofty mountains about this desolate locality. Mr. Bean
says: "<i>Astarte</i> seems always on the lookout for an entomologist,
whose advent is carefully noted, and at any approach of
such a monster nearer than about fifteen feet, its wings rise to
half-mast, vibrate there a doubtful instant, and away goes the
butterfly."</p>

<p>In addition to the thirteen species figured in our plates there
are two other species of the genus, <i>B. butleri</i>, Edwards, from
Grinnell Land, and <i>B. improba</i>, Butler, from near the arctic circle.
It is not likely that many of the readers of this book will encounter
these insects in their rambles, and if they should, they will be able
to ascertain their names quickly, by conferring with the author.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>SUSPICIOUS CONDUCT</b></p>

<p>The entomologist must not expect to be always thoroughly
understood. The ways of scientific men sometimes appear
strange, mysterious, bordering even upon the insane, to those
who are uninitiated. A celebrated American naturalist relates
that on one occasion, when chasing butterflies through a meadow
belonging to a farmer, the latter came out and viewed him with
manifest anxiety. But when the nature of the efforts of the man
of science had been finally explained, the farmer heaved a sigh
of relief, remarking, in Pennsylvania Dutch, that "he had surely
thought, when he first saw him, that he had just escaped from a
lunatic asylum." The writer, a number of years ago, after having
despatched a very comfortable lunch, sallied forth one afternoon,
in quest of insects, and in the course of his wanderings came
upon a refuse-heap by the roadside, opposite a substantial house,
and on this heap discovered an ancient ham, which was surrounded
by a multitude of beetles of various species known to
be partial to decomposed, or semi-decomposed, animal matter.
He proceeded immediately to bottle a number of the specimens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[ 137]</a></span>
While engaged in so doing, the window of the house across the
way was thrown up, and an elderly female thrust her head out,
and in strident voice exclaimed: "Hey, there! What are you
doin' with that ham? I say, don't you know that that ham is
spiled?" As he paid no attention to her, she presently appeared
at the door, came across the street, and remarked: "See here,
mister; that ham's spiled; Lucy and me throwed it out, knowin'
it was no good. If you want a good meal of wittles, come into
the house, and we will feed you, but for mercy's sake leave that
spiled ham alone." It took considerable effort to assure her that
no designs upon the ham were cherished, and she went away,
evidently completely mystified at the wild conduct of the well-dressed
man who was grubbing in the rubbish-pile.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Small. The tibi&aelig; and the tarsi of the mesothoracic
and metathoracic legs are more lightly armed with spines than in
the genera <i>Argynnis</i> and <i>Brenthis</i>. The palpi are not swollen.
They are clothed with long hairs and have the third joint finely
pointed. The antenn&aelig; are about half as long as the costa of the
fore wings, and are provided with a short, heavy, excavated, or
spoon-shaped club. The subcostal of the fore wings is five-branched,
the first nervule always arising before the end of the
cell, the second at the end or just beyond it. The cell of the primaries
is closed, of the secondaries open. The markings upon the
wings are altogether different from those in the two preceding
genera, and the spots on the under side of the wings are not
silvered, as in the genus <i>Brenthis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is rounded at the base, subconical, truncated,
and depressed at the upper end and fluted by light raised ridges
(see p. 4, Fig. 8).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[ 138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The larv&aelig; are cylindrical, armed in the mature
form on each segment with comparatively short spines thickly
covered with diverging hairs, or needle-shaped
spines. They are known in some species to
be gregarious in their early stages, and then
to separate before maturity. They feed upon
the <i>Scrophulariace&aelig;</i>, upon <i>Castileja</i>, <i>Diplopappus</i>,
and other plants.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is pendant,
rounded at the head, provided with more or
less sharply pointed tubercles on the dorsal
surface, and generally white or some shade
of light gray, blotched with brown or black,
and marked with reddish or orange spots
on the dorsal side.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 91.</a>&mdash;Neuration
of the genus <i>Melit&aelig;a</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>This genus is very large and is distributed widely over all the
colder portions of the north temperate zone. There are many
species found in Europe, in Siberia, in China, and in the northern
islands of Japan. On the upper slopes of the Himalayas it is also
represented by a few species. In North America the genus is
well represented, the most of the species being found upon the
mountain-slopes and in the valleys of the Pacific coast region.
Only two species occur in the Eastern States.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Melit&aelig;a pha&euml;ton</b>, Drury, Plate XVI, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Plate V,
Figs. 15, 16, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Baltimore).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The upper side is black, with a marginal row
of red spots, followed by three rows of pale-yellow spots on the
fore wings and two on the hind wings. Besides these there are
some large red spots on the cells of both wings, a large red spot
about the middle of the costa of the hind wing, and a few scattering
yellow spots, forming an incomplete fourth row on the
fore wing and an incomplete third row on the hind wing. On
the under side all the spots of the upper side reappear, but heavier
and more distinct, and on the hind wings there are two additional
rows of yellow spots, and a number of irregular patches of red
and yellow at the base of both wings.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female is much like the male. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.75-2.00
inches; &#9793;, 2.00-2.60 inches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XVI">Plate XVI</a></span></div>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg which is outlined upon p. 4, Fig. 8, is
brownish-yellow when first laid, then changes to crimson and
becomes black just before hatching. The eggs are laid by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[ 139]</a></span>
female in large clusters on the under side of the leaf of the food-plant.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The life-history in all the stages will be found
minutely described by Edwards in "The Butterflies of North
America," vol. ii, and by Scudder in "The Butterflies of New
England," vol. i. The mature larva is black, banded with
orange-red, and beset with short, bristly, black spines. Before
and during hibernation, which takes place after the third moult,
the caterpillars are gregarious, and construct for themselves a
web in which they pass the winter. After the rigors of winter
are past, and the food-plant, which is commonly <i>Chelone glabra</i>,
begins to send up fresh shoots, they recover animation, scatter,
and fall to feeding again, and after the fifth moult reach maturity.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is pendant, formed generally at a
considerable distance from the spot where the caterpillar feeds,
for the larv&aelig; wander off widely just before pupation. It is pearly-gray,
blotched with dark brown in stripes and spots, with some
orange markings.</p>

<p>This very beautiful butterfly is quite local, found in colonies in
swampy places where the food-plant grows, but in these spots
sometimes appearing in swarms. It occurs in the northern portions
of the United States and in Canada, extending as far north
as the Lake of the Woods, and as far south as West Virginia. It
does not occur west of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Melit&aelig;a chalcedon</b>, Doubleday and Hewitson, Plate
XVI, Fig. 2, &#9794; (Chalcedon).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male and female are much alike. The wings
are black, spotted with red and ochreous-yellow. On the under
side they are brick-red, with the spots of the upper side repeated,
and in addition at the base a number of large and distinct yellow
spots. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.75-2.00 inches; &#9793;, 2.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;For a knowledge of these the reader may consult
Edwards, "The Butterflies of North America," vol. i, and
"Papilio," vol. iv, p. 63; Wright, "Papilio," vol. iii, p. 123, and
other authorities. The egg is pale yellowish when first laid,
pitted at the base, and ribbed vertically above. The caterpillar is
black, with the bristling processes on the segments longer than
in the preceding species. The chrysalis is pale gray, blotched
with brown. The food-plants are <i>Mimulus</i> and <i>Castileja</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[ 140]</a></span></p>

<p>This very pretty species is apparently quite common in northern
California about Mount Shasta. It is subject to variation, and I
possess a dozen remarkable aberrations, in one of which the fore
wings are solid black without spots, and the hind wings marked
by only one central band of large yellow spots; another representing
the opposite color extreme, in which yellow has almost
wholly replaced the black and red. The majority of these aberrant
forms are females. They are very striking.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Melit&aelig;a macglashani</b>, Rivers, Plate XVI, Fig. 3, &#9794;
(Macglashan's Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Larger than the preceding species, with the red
spots on the outer margin bigger, the yellow spots generally larger
and paler. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.85-2.00 inches; &#9793;, 2.25-3.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This insect is represented in the Edwards collection by a considerable
series. They come from Truckee, California.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Melit&aelig;a colon</b>, Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig. 5, &#9794; (Colon).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Of the same size and general appearance as <i>M.
chalcedon</i>, with which I believe it to be identical, the only possible
satisfactory mark of distinction which I am able to discover
on comparing the types with a long series of <i>chalcedon</i> being
the reduced size of the marginal row of yellow spots on the
upper side of the primaries, which in one of the types figured in
the plate are almost obsolete. They appear, however, in other
specimens labeled "Type." The learned author of the species
lays stress, in his original description, upon the shape of the spots
composing the band of spots second from the margin on the
under side of the hind wings; but I find that the same points he
dwells upon as diacritic of this species are apparent in many
specimens of what undoubtedly are <i>chalcedon</i>. Expanse, 1.75-2.50
inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have not been recorded.</p>

<p>The types came from the region of the Columbia River, in
Washington and Oregon.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Melit&aelig;a anicia</b>, Doubleday and Hewitson, var. <b>beani</b>,
Skinner, Plate XVIII, Fig. 13, &#9794; (Bean's Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;<i>M. anicia</i> is a well-known Californian species,
smaller than <i>M. chalcedon</i>, and with a great deal of red on the
basal and discal areas of both wings upon the upper side. An
extremely small and dark form of this species, found on the bleak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[ 141]</a></span>
inhospitable mountain-tops about Laggan, in Alberta, has been
named by Dr. Skinner in honor of Mr. Bean, its discoverer. The
figure in our plate, which is taken from Dr. Skinner's original
type, sufficiently defines the characteristics of the upper surface.
Expanse, 1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The early stages of <i>M. anicia</i> and its varietal
forms are quite unknown.</p>

<p><i>M. anicia</i> is found in Colorado, Montana, Washington, and
British America.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Melit&aelig;a nubigena</b>, Behr, Plate XVI, Fig. 6, &#9794;; var.
<b>wheeleri</b>, Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig. 9, &#9794; (The Clouded Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Smaller than any of the foregoing species, and
characterized by the much redder ground-color of the upper side
of the wings, an extreme form being the variety <i>M. wheeleri</i>, in
which the black ground-color is greatly reduced and almost
wholly obliterated on parts of the primaries. There are other
marks of distinction given in the figures in the plate which will
enable the student easily to recognize this species, which is subject
to much variation, especially in the female sex. Expanse,
1.20-1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Mead, in the "Report upon the Lepidoptera of
the Wheeler Survey," has described the caterpillar and chrysalis.</p>

<p>The species is common in Nevada.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Melit&aelig;a augusta</b>, Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig. 4, &#9794; (Augusta).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly,</i>.&mdash;This is another species in which red predominates
as the color of the upper side, but it may at once be distinguished
by the broad, clear red band on the secondaries, on either side of
which are the marginal and outer median rows of yellow spots,
and by the bands of yellow spots on the primaries, which are not
so well marked in <i>M. nubigena</i>. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50-1.75 inch;
&#9793;, 1.75-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The habitat of this species is southern California.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Melit&aelig;a baroni</b>, Henry Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig 7, &#9794;
(Baron's Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species closely resembles <i>chalcedon</i> upon the
upper side, but is smaller and much more heavily spotted with deep
red on the upper side toward the base and on the median area of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[ 142]</a></span>
the wings. The bands of light spots on the under side are paler
than in <i>chalcedon</i>, being white or very pale yellow, narrow, and
more regular. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50-1.80 inch; &#9793;, 1.60-1.90 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are in part given by Edwards, "The
Butterflies of North America," vol. iii. The food-plant is <i>Castileja</i>.
The young larv&aelig; have the same habit as those of <i>M. pha&euml;ton</i> in
the matter of spinning a common web in which to hibernate.</p>

<p>The species is found in northern California.</p>

<p>(9) <b>Melit&aelig;a rubicunda</b>, Henry Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig. 10,
&#9794; (The Ruddy Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Of the same size as <i>M. baroni</i>, from which it is
most easily distinguished, among other things, by the tendency of
the outer row of small yellow spots near the margin of the hind
wings on the upper side to become greatly reduced, and in a majority
of specimens to be altogether wanting, as in the specimen
figured in our plate. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50-1.60 inch; &#9793;, 1.80 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;For a knowledge of what is thus far known of
these the reader may consult the "Canadian Entomologist," vol.
xvii, p. 155. The caterpillar feeds on <i>Scrophularia</i>.</p>

<p>The range of this species is in northern California.</p>

<p>(10) <b>Melit&aelig;a taylori</b>, Plate XVI, Fig. 16, &#9794; (Taylor's
Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This insect resembles <i>M. baroni</i>, but is smaller,
the red spots on the wings are larger and more conspicuous, and
the light bands of pale spots more regular and paler in color, in
many specimens being quite white. It looks at first sight like a
diminutive edition of Baron's Checker-spot, and possibly is only
a northern race of this species. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.25-1.50 inch; &#9793;,
1.50-1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Mr. W.H. Danby of Victoria, B.C., informs us
in the "Canadian Entomologist," vol. xxi, p. 121, that the food-plant
of this species is the ribwort-plantain (<i>Plantago lanceolata</i>,
Linn.).</p>

<p>It is found on Vancouver's Island.</p>

<p>(11) <b>Melit&aelig;a editha</b>, Boisduval, Plate XVI, Fig. 8, &#9794; (Editha).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Characterized by the considerable enlargement and
the disposition in regular bands of the pale spots on the upper side
of the primaries, and by the tendency to a grayish cast in the darker
markings of the upper side, some specimens, especially females,
being quite gray. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50 inch; &#9793;, 2.00 inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[ 143]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The food-plants, according to Henry Edwards,
who described the caterpillar and chrysalis in the "Canadian
Entomologist," vol. v, p. 167, are <i>Erodium cicutarium</i>, clover,
and violets.</p>

<p>The habitat of this species is southern California.</p>

<p>(12) <b>Melit&aelig;a acastus</b>, Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig. 11, &#9794;; Fig.
12, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (Acastus).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;With thinner and less robust wings than any of the
species of the genus hitherto mentioned. It is prevalently fulvous
upon the upper side, and on the under side of the hind wings
heavily and somewhat regularly banded with yellowish-white
spots, possessing some pearly luster. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50 inch;
&#9793;, 1.60 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>Common in Nevada, Utah, and Montana.</p>

<p>(13) <b>Melit&aelig;a palla</b>, Boisduval, Plate XVI, Fig. 13, &#9794;; Fig.
14, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (The Northern Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;On the upper side resembling the preceding species,
but with the median band of spots on the hind wings paler.
On the under side the markings are different, as is shown in
the plate. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50 inch; &#9793;, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The larva and chrysalis were described by
Henry Edwards, the actor naturalist, in the "Proceedings of the
California Academy of Sciences," vol. v, p. 167. The food-plant
is <i>Castileja</i>.</p>

<p>The species ranges from California to Colorado, and northward
into British Columbia.</p>

<p>(14) <b>Melit&aelig;a whitneyi</b>, Behr, Plate XVII, Fig. 7, &#9794;; Fig. 8,
&#9794;, <i>under side</i> (Whitney's Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The markings are much as in <i>M. palla</i>, the spots
are lighter fulvous and larger than in that species, the yellow
bands on the under side are more prominent, and the marginal
spots have a silvery luster which is lacking in <i>M. palla</i>. The
female has the yellow of the under side more prominent than is
the case in the male sex. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50 inch; &#9793;, 1.70 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Altogether unknown.</p>

<p>Whitney's Checker-spot ranges from California into Nevada.</p>

<p>(15) <b>Melit&aelig;a hoffmanni</b>, Behr, Plate XVII, Fig. 13, &#9794;; Fig.
14, &#9793;, <i>aberration</i> (Hoffmann's Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;General style of marking much as in the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[ 144]</a></span>
preceding species, but with the basal area black, and the black
markings toward the outer margin not so heavy, giving it here
a more fulvous appearance. The median bands on both wings
are broader and paler than in <i>M. palla.</i> The under side is much
as in the last-mentioned species, but the yellow markings are
more prominent.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;Much like the male. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.35 inch; &#9793;, 1.45
inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This species, which is found in California and Nevada, is
subject to extreme variation, and I have placed upon the plate
one out of many beautiful and singular aberrations which I
possess.</p>

<p>(16) <b>Melit&aelig;a gabbi</b>, Behr, Plate XVI, Fig. 15, &#9794; (Gabb's
Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;In the style of its markings on the upper side it
almost completely resembles <i>M. acastus</i>, but the dark markings
are slighter, giving the wings a more fulvous appearance. On
the under side the bands are narrower, defined more sharply
with black, and pearly, almost silvery white, whereas in <i>acastus</i>
they are pale yellowish-white, and not so lustrous. Expanse, &#9794;,
1.20 inch; &#9793;, 1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The habitat of this species is southern California.</p>

<p>(17) <b>Melit&aelig;a harrisi</b>, Scudder, Plate XVII, Fig. 5, &#9794;; Fig.
6, &#9793;, <i>under side</i>; Plate V, Figs. 17-18, <i>chrysalis</i> (Harris'
Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;Wings fulvous, black at the base and on the
outer margin, with five fulvous spots in the cell of the fore wing,
two below the cell; and three in the cell of the hind wing.
The black border is widest at the apex of the fore wing, and below
this runs inwardly on the veins. There are two white spots
near the apex. At the anal angle on the hind wing the border
is somewhat divided so as to present the appearance of two indistinct
lines. On the under side the wings are fulvous, marked
with black bands and spots, and crossed by bands and crescents
of pale yellow, as is shown in the figure on the plate.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female is much like the male. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50
inch; &#9793;, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs are lemon-yellow, in the form of a truncated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[ 145]</a></span>
cone, with fifteen or sixteen vertical ribs, which are highest
about the middle.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The matured caterpillar is reddish-fulvous, with
a black stripe on the back. Each segment is marked with one
black ring before and two black rings behind the sets of spiny
tubercles with which the segments are adorned. There are nine
rows of spines, those above the feet being quite small. The
spines are black, tapering, and set with diverging black hairs.
The food-plants are aster and <i>Diplopappus umbellatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is pearly-gray or white, blotched
with dark brown or black.</p>

<p>This choice little butterfly ranges from Nova Scotia to Wisconsin,
extending as far south as northern Illinois, and northward
to Ottawa.</p>

<p>(18) <b>Melit&aelig;a elada</b>, Hewitson, Plate XVII, Fig. 2, &#9794;
(Hewitson's Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The wings on the upper side are black, crossed
by numerous bands of small fulvous spots, the one crossing
the middle of the median area being composed of the largest
spots. The fore wings on the under side are fulvous, shading
outwardly into ferruginous. The spots and bands of the upper
side reappear upon the under side, but are lighter, and the submarginal
row of crescents is pale yellow and very distinct, the
spot between the second and third median nervules being the
largest, and the spot between the fourth and fifth subcostals
being only a little smaller. The under side of the hind wings is
deep ferruginous, crossed by bands of pearly pale-yellow spots,
those of the outer margin being the largest.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female is much like the male, with the ground-color
a little paler. Expanse, &#9794;, .90 inch; &#9793;, 1.00-1.10 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This little species is found in western Texas, Arizona, and
northern Mexico.</p>

<p>(19) <b>Melit&aelig;a dymas</b>, Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig. 18, &#9793;
(Dymas).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is closely related in size and the style
of some of the markings to the foregoing species, but may be
at once distinguished by the lighter ground-color, which is pale
fulvous, and the totally different style of the marginal markings
on the under side of the wings. The female represented in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[ 146]</a></span>
plate is a trifle paler than the male. Expanse, &#9794;, .85 inch; &#9793;,
1.00 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The habitat of this species is southwestern Texas.</p>

<p>(20) <b>Melit&aelig;a perse</b>, Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig. 19, &#9794;
(Perse).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This is nearly related to the two foregoing species,
but the ground-color is darker fulvous than in <i>dymas</i>, the markings
are slight as in that species, and the arrangement of the
spots and bands on the under side is similar. The marginal
crescents on the under side of the primaries are largest at the
apex and rapidly diminish in size, vanishing altogether about
the middle of the wing. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.00 inch; &#9793;, 1.10 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These remain to be discovered.</p>

<p>The only specimens so far found have come from Arizona.</p>

<p>(21) <b>Melit&aelig;a chara</b>, Edwards, Plate XVII, Fig. 3, &#9794;; Fig.
4, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (Chara).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;No lengthy description of this pretty little species
is required, as the plate, which gives both sides of the wings,
shows their peculiarities with sufficient accuracy to enable an
exact determination to be made. The whitish spot on the costa
before the apex on the upper side, and the chalky-white markings
and spots on the under side, serve at once to distinguish
this form from its near allies. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.00 inch; &#9793;, 1.25
inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>I have a large series of this species, all from Arizona, where
it appears to be common.</p>

<p>(22) <b>Melit&aelig;a leanira</b>, Boisduval, Plate XVI, Fig. 20, &#9793;
(Leanira).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;Ground-color brownish-black, fulvous on the
costa, with submarginal, median, and basal rows of yellow spots.
Both the primaries and secondaries have a marginal row of red
spots, and the former have in addition a submarginal row of such
spots. The under side of the primaries is reddish-fulvous, with
the markings of the upper side reproduced. The secondaries
have a marginal row of yellow crescents, then a black band inclosing
yellow spots, then a median band of long yellow crescents.
The remainder of the wing to its insertion is black, spotted
with yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[ 147]</a></span></p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;Much like the male. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50 inch; &#9793;, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This pretty insect ranges from southern California and Arizona
to Nevada, Montana, and British America.</p>

<p>(23) <b>Melit&aelig;a wrighti</b>, Edwards, Plate XVII, Fig. 9, &#9794;; Fig.
10, &#9793;, <i>under side,</i> (Wright's Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Much like <i>M. leanira</i>, but with more fulvous upon
the upper side of the wings, and the under side yellow. The
black bands on the secondaries are reduced, and the dividing-lines
between the spots are confined to the nervules, which are
narrowly black. This is probably only a varietal form of the
preceding species. I figure the types. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.30 inch;
&#9793;, 1.80 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>Habitat, southern California.</p>

<p>(24) <b>Melit&aelig;a alma</b>, Strecker, Plate XVII, Fig. 1, &#9794; (Strecker's
Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The upper side of the wings is bright fulvous,
with the margins and veins black. There are three rows of
transverse spots paler than the ground-color. The fore wings on
the under side are pale fulvous, with pale-yellow spots and a submarginal
and marginal row of yellow spots separated by a narrow
black line. The hind wings on this side are yellow, with the
veins and margins black, and a transverse double band of black
on the outer margin of the median area.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;Much like the male, but larger, and redder on the upper
side. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.25 inch; &#9793;, 1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The specimens I have came from the Death Valley. The species
occurs in southern Utah and Arizona.</p>

<p>(25) <b>Melit&aelig;a thekla</b>, Edwards, Plate XVII, Fig. 15, &#9794;, <i>under
side</i>; Fig. 16, &#9794; (Thekla).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The upper side of the wings is fulvous, black
toward the base and on the outer margin. The primaries are
adorned with a large oval pale-fulvous spot at the end of the cell,
a small one on the middle of the upper side of the cell, and another
small one below the cell, at the origin of the first median nervule.
The discal area is defined outwardly by a very irregular fine black
transverse line, beyond which is a transverse band of pale-fulvous
oblong spots, an incomplete series of spots of the ground-color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[ 148]</a></span>
sharply defined upon the black outer shade, followed by a row of
irregular white submarginal spots. The transverse bands of spots
on the primaries are repeated upon the secondaries, where they
are more regular and the spots more even in size. On the under
side both wings are pale red, with the light spots of the upper side
reappearing as pale-yellow sharply defined spots. The fringes are
checkered black and white.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;Much like the male, but larger. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.35-1.50
inch; &#9793;, 1.50-1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This species is common in Texas. It is identical, as an examination
of the type shows, with <i>M. bolli</i>, Edwards, and the
latter name as a synonym falls into disuse.</p>

<p>(26) <b>Melit&aelig;a minuta</b>, Edwards, Plate XVII, Fig. 11, &#9794;,
<i>under side</i>; Fig. 12, &#9794; (The Smaller Checker-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;This species is fulvous on the upper side, rather
regularly banded with black lines. The veins are also black. The
result is that the wings appear to be more regularly checkered than
in any other species which is closely allied to this. The markings
of the under side are white edged with black, and are shown very
well in the plate, so that a lengthy description is unnecessary.
Expanse, &#9794;, 1.25-1.35 inch; &#9793;, 1.50-1.60 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i>minuta</i>, is not altogether appropriate.
There are many smaller species of the genus. It is found rather
commonly in Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico.</p>

<p>(27) <b>Melit&aelig;a arachne</b>, Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig. 22, &#9793;
(Arachne).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;I have given in the plate a figure of a female bearing
this name in the Edwards collection. It is remarkably pale
on the upper side. There is a large series of types and paratypes
in the collection, but all of them vary on the upper side of the
wings in the intensity of the fulvous ground-color and the width
of the black markings. Underneath they are absolutely like <i>M.
minuta</i>. I think <i>M. arachne</i> is without much doubt a synonym
for <i>M. minuta</i>. The species varies very greatly. The types are
from Colorado and western Texas. Expanse as in <i>M. minuta</i>.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>(28) <b>Melit&aelig;a nympha</b>, Edwards, Plate XVI, Fig. 21, &#9794;
(Nympha).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[ 149]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species differs from <i>M. minuta</i> only in having
the black markings darker and the outer median bands of spots
on the upper side yellow. On the under side the pattern of the
markings is exactly as in <i>M. minuta</i>. It seems to me to be a
dark, aberrant form of <i>M. minuta</i>, but is very well marked, and
constant in a large series of specimens, so that we cannot be sure
until some one breeds these creatures from the egg. Expanse,
the same as that of <i>M. minuta</i>.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>Habitat, Arizona.</p>

<p>In addition to the species of the genus <i>Melit&aelig;a</i> illustrated in our
plates there are a few others which are credited to our fauna, some
of these correctly and some erroneously, and a number of so-called
species have been described which are not true species, but varieties
or aberrations.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>COLLECTING IN JAPAN</b></p>

<p>I was tired of the Seiyo-ken, the only hotel at which foreigners
could be entertained without the discomfort of sleeping upon the
floor. There is a better hotel in Tokyo now. I had looked out
for five days from my window upon the stinking canal through
which the tide ebbs and flows in Tsukiji. I felt if I stayed longer
in the lowlands that I would contract malarial fever or some other
uncomfortable ailment, and resolved to betake myself to the mountains,
the glorious mountains, which rise all through the interior
of the country, wrapped in verdure, their giant summits capped
with clouds, many of them the abode of volcanic thunder. So I
went by rail to the terminus of the road, got together the coolies
to pull and push my jinrikishas, and, accompanied by a troop of
native collectors, made my way up the Usui-toge, the pass over
which travelers going from western Japan into eastern Japan
laboriously crept twelve years ago.</p>

<p>What a sunset when we reached an elevation of three thousand
feet above the paddy-fields which stretch across the Kwanto
to the Gulf of Yeddo! What a furious thunder-storm came on just
as night closed in! Then at half-past nine the moon struggled
out from behind the clouds, and we pushed on up over the muddy
roads, until at last a cold breath of night air sweeping from the
west began to fan our faces, and we realized that we were at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[ 150]</a></span>
top of the pass, and before us in the dim moonlight loomed the
huge form of Asama-yama, that furious volcano, which more than
once has laid the land waste for leagues around, and compared
with which Vesuvius is a pygmy. We slept on Japanese mats,
and in the morning, the drops glittering on every leaf, we started
out to walk through the fields to Oiwake, our baggage going forward,
we intending to loiter all day amid the charms of nature.
Seven species of lilies bloomed about us in the hedges and the
fields; a hundred plants, graceful and beautiful in blossom, scented
the air with their aroma, and everywhere were butterflies and
bees. Above us hung in the sky a banner, the great cloud which
by day and by night issues from the crater of Asama-yama.
Five species of fritillaries flashed their silvery wings by copse
and stream; great black papilios soared across the meadows;
blue lyc&aelig;nas, bright chrysophani, and a dozen species of wood-nymphs
gamboled over the low herbage and among the grass.
Torosan, my chief collector, was in his element. "Dana-san"
(<i>my lord</i>, or <i>my master</i>), "this kind Yokohama no have got."
"Dana-san, this kind me no catchee Tokyo side." And so we
wandered down the mountain-slope, taking species new alike to
American and Japanese, until the sun was sinking in the west.
The cloud-banner had grown crimson and purple in the sunset
when we wandered into the hospitable doorway of the wayside
inn at Oiwake. There we made our headquarters for the week,
and thence we carried away a thousand butterflies and moths
and two thousand beetles as the guerdon of our chase.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The butterflies composing this genus are generally
quite small. Their wings on the upper side are fulvous, or
brown with black margins, spots, and lines upon the upper side
of the wings, and with the under side of the wings reproducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[ 151]</a></span>
the spots of the upper side in paler tints. Of the spots of the under
side of the wings one of the most characteristic is the pale crescent
situated on the outer margin of the hind wings,
between the ends of the second and third median
nervules. This spot is frequently pearly-white
or silvered. Structurally the butterflies of
this genus may be distinguished from the preceding
genus by the enlarged second joint of the
palpi and the very fine, extremely pointed third
joint. In the neuration of the wings and in their
habits these butterflies closely approximate
<i>Melit&aelig;a</i>.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 92.</a>&mdash;Neuration
of the genus
<i>Phyciodes</i>.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Eggs.</i>&mdash;The eggs are always higher than
broad, with the surface at the base more or
less pitted, giving them a thimble-like appearance. On the
upper end in some species they have a few short, vertical ridges,
radiating from the micropyle.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is cylindrical, marked with pale
longitudinal stripes upon a darker ground, and adorned with
tubercles arranged in regular rows. These tubercles are generally
much shorter than in the genus <i>Melit&aelig;a</i>. The caterpillars do not,
so far as is known, weave webs at any time.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is pendant, with the head slightly
bifid. The dorsal region of the abdomen is provided with slight
tubercles. The color is generally some shade of pale gray,
blotched with black or dark brown.</p>

<p>This genus finds its principal development in South and Central
America, which are very rich in species, some of them
mimicking in a most marvelous manner the butterflies of the protected
genus <i>Heliconius</i> and its allies. The species found in the
United States and Canada are for the most part not very gaily
colored insects, chaste shades of brown, or yellow, and black
predominating.</p>

be distinguished by the lighter color of the base of the wing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[ 152]</a></span>
and the pale, silvery crescent on the outer margin. Expanse, &#9794;
1.25-1.65 inch; &#9793;, 1.65-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is half as high again as broad, marked with
sixteen or seventeen vertical ribs above, and pitted about the
middle by hexagonal cells. It is pale green in color.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar undergoes four moults after
hatching. In the mature stage it is velvety-black, with a dull
orange stripe along the back, and purplish streaks on the sides.
The body is studded with whitish spots, each giving rise to a
delicate black hair, and is further beset with rather short, black,
hairy spines.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is pearly-gray, blotched with dark
brown.</p>

<p>The life-history of this species has been carefully worked out,
and all the details may be found described in the most minute
manner by Edwards and by Scudder.</p>

<p>The insect ranges from Maine to North Carolina, and thence
westward to the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;Easily distinguished from all other allied species
by the double row of small light spots on the dark margin of the
fore wings on the upper side, and by the silvery, narrow, and
greatly bent line of bright silvery spots crossing the middle of the
hind wings on the under side.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female is like the male, but larger and paler and all
the spots on the upper side are pale fulvous, and not as distinctly
white on the outer margin as in the male sex. Expanse, &#9794;,
1.15-1.35 inch; &#9793;, 1.35-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar, according to Boisduval and
Leconte, is yellowish, with blackish spines and three longitudinal
blackish stripes. The head, the thoracic legs, and the under side
are black; the other legs are yellow.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;According to the same authors, the chrysalis is
pale gray, with paler light spots and nearly white dorsal tubercles.</p>

<p>This insect ranges over a wide territory from Canada to the
Southern and Western States east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Phyciodes vesta</b>, Edwards, Plate XVII, Fig. 17, &#9794;; Fig.

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The ground-color of the male is paler on the
upper side than in <i>Phyciodes tharos</i>, and the black markings are
much heavier. The median band on the fore wings is yellowish.
The wings on the under side are yellow, shaded with fulvous on
the primaries, on which the dark markings are heavy.</p>

Plate V, Figs. 20-22, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Pearl Crescent).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This very common and well-known little insect
scarcely needs to be described. The upper side is bright fulvous,
with heavy black borders; all the other dark markings are slight.
The wings on the under side are paler, with the dark markings of
the upper side showing through, and there are additional markings
of brown on the hind wings. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.25 inch; &#9793;, 1.65 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The early stages of this insect have been
worked out with the most extreme care by Mr. Edwards, and the
reader who is curious to know about them should consult "The
Butterflies of North America." Dr. Scudder also has minutely
and laboriously described the early stages in "The Butterflies of
New England." The egg is light greenish-yellow. The caterpillar,
which feeds upon various species of aster and allied <i>Composit&aelig;</i>,
is dark brown after the third moult, its back dotted with
yellow, adorned with short, black, bristly spines, which are yellow
at the base. The chrysalis is grayish-white, mottled with
dark spots and lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[ 154]</a></span></p>

<p>This species is one of many dimorphic species, the winter
form <i>marcia</i>, which emerges in spring, having the under side
brighter, and the light markings more conspicuous on that side
than in the summer form, which has been called <i>morpheus</i>. Concerning
all of this, and the way in which cold affects the color of
butterflies, the reader will do well to consult the splendid pages
of Edwards and of Scudder.</p>

to Florida; in fact, all over North America north of Texas and
south of the region of Hudson Bay, except the Pacific coast of
California.</p>

<i>under side</i>; Fig. 41, &#9794; (The Mylitta Crescent).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;Broadly bright fulvous on the upper side,
with the dark markings slight; on the under side closely resembling

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described by Mr. Harrison G.
Dyar in the "Canadian Entomologist," vol. xxiii, p. 203. The
eggs are laid in clusters upon the thistle (<i>Carduus</i>). The caterpillar
in its final stage after the fourth moult is black, yellowish
below, with a faint twinned yellow dorsal line and faint lines of
the same color on the sides. The spines, which are arranged in
six rows, are black; those of segments four, five, and six, yellow.
The chrysalis is dull wood-brown.</p>

<p>This species has a wide range in the region of the Rocky
Mountains, extending from Washington to Arizona, and eastward
to Colorado.</p>

fulvous of the upper side of the wings more widely extended,
causing the dark markings to be greatly restricted. The figure
in the plate is, in this species as in most others, that of the type,
and I am under obligations to Dr. Skinner for kind permission to
have the use of the specimen. Expanse, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p>The type came from Colorado Springs.</p>

<i>under side</i>; Fig. 27, &#9793; (The Mountain Crescent-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Upon the upper side the wings are marked
much as in <i>P. camillus</i>, but are prevalently bright fulvous, with
the dark markings quite slight in most specimens. On the
under side the wings are pale yellowish-fulvous. The female
usually has the secondaries crossed by a broad median band of
very pale spots. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.25 inch; &#9793;, 1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The habitat of this species is the Sierras of California and

<p>(13) <b>Phyciodes picta</b>, Edwards, Plate XVII, Fig. 20, &#9793;,
<i>under side</i>; Fig. 21, &#9794; (The Painted Crescent-spot).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The butterfly in both sexes somewhat closely resembles
<i>P. phaon</i> on the upper side. On the under side the fore
wings are red on the median area, with the base, the costa, the
apex, and the outer margin pale yellow; the black markings very
prominent. The hind wings on the under side are nearly immaculate
yellow. Expanse, &#9794;, .80-1.10 inch; &#9793;, 1.10-1.25 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These may be found described with minute exactness
by Mr. W.H. Edwards in the pages of the "Canadian
Entomologist," vol. xvi, pp. 163-167. The egg is yellowish-green.
The caterpillar moults five times. When mature it is
about six tenths of an inch long, armed with seven principal
rows of short spines, which appear to vary in color in the spring
and fall broods, being light brown in the June brood and greenish-yellow
in the October brood. The prevalent color of the caterpillar
is some shade of yellowish-or greenish-brown, mottled
with lighter and darker tints. The chrysalis is yellowish-brown.
The food-plants of the caterpillar are various species of aster.</p>

<p>This species is found as far north as Nebraska, and is abundant
in Colorado and New Mexico, ranging southward through Arizona
into Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Small butterflies, closely resembling the species of
the genus <i>Phyciodes</i> in the neuration of the wings, and only differing
from them in the outline of the outer margin of the primaries,
which are more or less excavated about the middle.
In the style of the markings they differ
somewhat widely from the butterflies of the genus
<i>Phyciodes</i>, notably in the absence of the crescents
on the margins of the wings. The wings on the
upper side are generally some shade of deep brown
or black, marked with spots and bands of white
or fulvous, the median band on the hind wings
being generally more or less conspicuous. In the
pattern of their markings they illustrate a transition
from the genus <i>Phyciodes</i> to the genus <i>Synchlo&euml;.</i></p>

as <i>Diclippa</i> and <i>Actinomeris</i>.</p>

<p>The genus, which is somewhat doubtfully separable from <i>Phyciodes</i>,
and probably possesses only subgeneric value, is well

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Upper side reddish-fulvous, clouded with fuscous
at the base. On the basal area are waved black lines, separate
on the hind wings, more or less blended on the fore wings.
The outer border is broadly black. Between this border and
the basal third the wing is crossed by irregular black bands, the
spaces between which are paler fulvous than the base and the
hind wings, those near the outer margin being whitish. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[ 158]</a></span>
bands are continued broadly across the hind wings. The
wings on the under side are fulvous, mottled with dark brown

male and the female closely resemble each other. Expanse, 1.40
inch.</p>

<p>The early stages are wholly unknown.</p>

<p>The only locality within the limits of the United States in

<p>(2) <b>Eresia texana</b>, Edwards, Plate XVIII, Fig. 8, &#9793;; Fig. 9,
&#9794;, <i>under side</i> (The Texan Eresia).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Black on the upper side of the wings, shading
into reddish-brown on the basal area. The fore wings are
spotted on the median and limbal areas with white, and the hind
wings are adorned by a conspicuous median band of small white
spots. On the under side the fore wings are fulvous at the base,
broadly dark brown beyond the middle. The light spots of the
upper side reappear on the lower side. The hind wings on
the under side are marbled wood-brown on the basal area and the
inner margin, darker brown externally. The white macular band
of the upper side reappears on this side, but less distinct than
above. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.25-1.50 inch; &#9793;, 1.60-1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;For the only account of the life-history of this
species the reader is referred to the "Canadian Entomologist,"
vol. xi, p. 127, where the indefatigable Edwards gives us an
interesting account of his original observations.</p>

<p>This insect ranges from Texas into Mexico. It has been confounded
by some with a closely allied insect, <b>Eresia ianthe</b>,
Fabricius, and to show the difference we have given in Plate
XVIII, Fig. 12, a representation of that species, by means of which
the reader will be enabled to mark the difference on the upper

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;A lengthy description of this little species is
scarcely necessary, as the figure in the plate will suffice for its
accurate determination. Nothing is known of its early stages.
Expanse, 1.10 inch. It is found in New Mexico, Texas, Arizona,
and Mexico. It has been recently declared to be identical with
<i>E. tulcis</i>, Bates, an opinion I am not quite prepared to accept, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[ 159]</a></span>
which, if correct, will force us, according to the law of priority,
to substitute the name given by Bates for that given by Edwards.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus SYNCHLO&Euml;, Boisduval</b>
<b>(The Patched Butterflies</b>)</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Medium-sized or small butterflies, rather gaily
colored, although the species found in the United States are not
very brilliant. They may be distinguished structurally from the
butterflies of the two preceding genera not
only by their larger size and the spindle-formed
third article of the palpi, which in
the genera <i>Eresia</i> and <i>Phyciodes</i> is thin and
pointed like a needle, but also by the fact
that the lower discocellular vein of the fore
wings is generally quite straight and not
bowed or angled as in the before-mentioned
genera.</p>

and slightly depressed at top, rounded at the
bottom; the lower three fifths with shallow
depressions; the upper part with about twenty-four light blunt-edged
ribs. The eggs are laid in clusters upon the leaves of
<i>Helianthus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;Varying in color, generally black or some shade
of red or brown, covered with spines which are arranged as in
the genus <i>Melit&aelig;a</i> and are thickly beset with diverging bristles.
The caterpillar moults four times.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;Shaped as in the genus <i>Melit&aelig;a</i>, light in color,
blotched with dark brown or black spots and lines.</p>

<p>The genus is well represented in Central and South America.
Some of the species are polymorphic, many varieties being produced
from a single batch of eggs. The result has been considerable
confusion in the specific nomenclature.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Synchlo&euml; janais</b>, Drury, Plate XVIII, Fig. 10, &#9794; (The

hind wings black above, marked in the center with a broad band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[ 160]</a></span>
of crimson. On the under side the markings of the upper side
of the fore wings are reproduced. The hind wings on the under
side are black at the base and on the outer third; immediately at
the base is a yellow bar; across the middle is a broad yellow
band laved outwardly by red, upon which are numerous black
spots. There is a marginal row of yellow spots and an inner
row of smaller white spots on the limbal area. Expanse, 2.50-3.00
inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;What is known of these is contained in articles
published by Mr. William Schaus, "Papilio," vol. iii, p. 188;
and by Henry Edwards, "Entomologica Americana," vol. iii,
p. 161, to which the reader may refer.</p>

<p>The habitat of the species is Texas, Mexico, and Central
America. The insect is very variable in the markings both of
the upper and under sides, and several so-called species are only
varietal forms of this.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Synchlo&euml; lacinia</b>, H&uuml;bner, Plate XVIII, Fig. 11, &#9794;;
form <b>crocale</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIV, Fig. 8, &#9794;, <i>under side</i>;
Fig. 9, &#9794; (Lacinia).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This is a protean species, a dozen or more well-marked
varietal forms being produced, many of them from a
single batch of eggs. The wings on the upper side are black;
both primaries and secondaries are crossed about the middle by
a band of spots, generally broken on the primaries and continuous
on the secondaries. These spots in the typical form <i>lacinia</i> are
fulvous, and the bands are broad. In the form <i>crocale</i> the spots
are white, the bands narrow. A great variety of intergrading
forms are known and are represented in the author's collection,
most of them bred specimens reared from the egg. On the
under side the fore wings are marked as on the upper side. The
hind wings on the under side are black, with a marginal row of
spots, a transverse straight median band, a short basal band, and
a costal edging, all bright straw-yellow; in addition there is a
submarginal row of small white spots and a crimson patch of
variable size at the anal angle. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.50-2.00 inches; &#9793;,
1.75-2.75 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are described fully by Edwards in the

<p class="cen"><b>FAUNAL REGIONS</b></p>

<p>That branch of zo&ouml;logical science which treats of the geographical
distribution of animals is known as zo&ouml;geography. None of the
zo&ouml;logical sciences has contributed more to a knowledge of the facts
with which zo&ouml;geography deals than the science of entomology.</p>

<p>Various divisions of the surface of the earth, based upon the
character of the living beings which inhabit them, have been suggested.
At the present time, however, it is agreed that in a
general way five major subdivisions are sufficient for the purposes
of the science, and we therefore recognize five faunal regions,
namely, the <i>Pal&aelig;arctic</i>, which includes the temperate regions of
the eastern hemisphere; the <i>Indo-Malayan</i>, covering the tropics
of Asia and the islands lying south of that great continent, including
Australia; the <i>Ethiopian</i>, covering the continent of Africa
south of the lands bordering on the Mediterranean, and extending
northward into the southern part of Arabia; the <i>Neotropical</i>,
covering the continent of South America and the islands of the
Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico; and, finally, the <i>Nearctic</i>,
covering the temperate and polar regions of North America. The
butterflies with which this volume deals are mostly nearctic
species, only a few species representing the neotropical region
being found as stragglers into the extreme southern portion of
the United States.</p>

<p>These five faunal regions are characterized by the presence of
certain groups of insects which are more or less peculiar to them.
In the Pal&aelig;arctic Region, for instance, we find a very great development
of the <i>Satyrin&aelig;</i>, of the genera <i>Argynnis</i>, <i>Melit&aelig;a</i>,
and <i>Lyc&aelig;na</i>, and of the genus <i>Colias</i>. The genus <i>Papilio</i> is but
poorly represented, there being only three species found on the
entire continent of Europe, and comparatively few in Asia north
of the Himalayan mountain-ranges.</p>

<p>As soon as we pass from the boundaries of the Pal&aelig;arctic
Region into India there is discovered a great number of species
of the genus <i>Papilio</i>. The <i>Eupl&oelig;in&aelig;</i>, of various genera, swarm,
and splendid creatures, magnificent in color, present themselves,
replacing among the <i>Nymphalin&aelig;</i> the small and obscurely colored
forms which are found among the mountains of Europe and
on the great Asiatic steppes. In the Indo-Malayan Region one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[ 162]</a></span>
of the most gorgeous of the papilionine genera is known as <i>Ornithoptera</i>.
These great "bird-wing" butterflies are most brilliant
in color in the male, and in the female attain an expanse of wing
reaching in some species eight and even nine inches, so that it
would be impossible to represent them in their natural dimensions
upon a page such as that which is before the reader. One
of these giants of the butterfly family, named <i>Victoria</i> after her
Majesty the Queen of England, is found in the Solomon Islands,
and is probably the largest of all known butterflies. One specimen,
belonging to the author, has an expanse of wing exceeding
nine inches. Among the strangest of recent discoveries is <i>Ornithoptera
paradisea</i>, which is found in New Guinea. The male has
the hind wings produced in the form of a very delicate and slender
tail; the upper surfaces of the wing are broadly marked with
shining green and lustrous orange upon a velvety-black ground.
The female is black with white spots, slightly marked with yellow,
being obscure in color, as is for the most part characteristic
of this sex among butterflies, as well as other animals.</p>

<p>The Ethiopian Region is rich in beautiful butterflies of the genus
<i>Callosune</i>, which are white or yellow, having the tips of the anterior
wings marked with crimson or purple. There are many
scores of species of these which are found on the grassy park-like
lands of southeastern Africa, and they range northward through
Abyssinia into Arabia, and a few species even invade the hot
lands of the Indian peninsula. In the great forests of the Congo
and in fact throughout tropical Africa, the genus <i>Acr&aelig;a</i>, composed
of beautiful insects with long, narrow wings like the genus
<i>Heliconius</i>, but for the most part yellow, rich brown, and red,
spotted with black, abound. And here, too, are found some of
the noblest species belonging to the great genus <i>Papilio</i>, among
them that most singular and, until recently, rarest of the genus,
<i>Papilio antimachus</i> of Drury, one specimen of which, among a
dozen or more in the author's possession, has wings which exceed
in expanse even those of <i>Ornithoptera victoria</i>, though this butterfly,
which seems to mimic the genus <i>Acr&aelig;a</i>, has comparatively
narrow wings, and they, therefore, do not cover so large an
area as is covered in the case of the genus <i>Ornithoptera</i>.</p>

<p>In the Neotropical Region we are confronted by swarms of
butterflies belonging to the <i>Ithomiin&aelig;</i>, the <i>Heliconiin&aelig;</i>, and the
<i>Acr&aelig;in&aelig;</i>, all of which are known to be protected species, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[ 163]</a></span>
which are mimicked by other species among the butterflies and
moths of the region which they frequent. A naturalist familiar
with the characteristics of the butterfly fauna of South America
can at a glance determine whether a collection placed before him
is from that country or not, merely by his knowledge of the
peculiar coloration which is characteristic of the lepidoptera of
the region. The most brilliant butterflies of the neotropical
fauna are the <i>Morphos</i>, glorious insects, the under side of their
wings marked with eye-like spots, the upper side resplendent in
varying tints of iridescent blue.</p>

<p>In the Nearctic Region there is a remarkable development of
the genera <i>Argynnis</i>, <i>Melit&aelig;a</i>, and <i>Phyciodes</i>. There are also a
great many species of the <i>Satyrin&aelig;</i> and of the <i>Hesperiid&aelig;</i>, or
"skippers." The genus <i>Colias</i> is also well represented. The
Nearctic Region extends southwardly into northern Mexico, at
high elevations, and is even continued along the chain of the
Andes, and there are species which are found in the vicinity of
San Francisco which occur in Chili and Patagonia. In fact, when
we get to the southern extremity both of Africa and of South
America we find certain genera characteristic of the north temperate
zone, or closely allied to them, well represented.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus GRAPTA, Kirby</b>

<b>(The Angle-Wings)</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Medium-sized or small, characterized by the more
or less deeply excavated inner and outer margins of the fore wings,
the tail-like projection of the hind wings at the extremity
of the third median nervule, the closed cell
of the same wings, and the thick squamation of
the palpi on the under side, while on the sides
and tops of the palpi there are but few scales.
They are tawny on the upper side, spotted and
bordered with black; on the under side mimicking
the bark of trees and dead leaves, often with
a c-shaped silvery spot on the hind wings. The
insects hibernate in the butterfly form in hollow
trees and other hiding-places.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs are taller than broad, taper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[ 164]</a></span>ing upward from
the base. The summit is broad and flat. The
sides are marked by a few equidistant narrow longitudinal ribs,
which increase in height to the top. A few delicate cross-lines
are interwoven between these ribs. They are laid in clusters or
in short string-like series (see p. 5, Fig. 10).</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The head is somewhat quadrate in outline, the
body cylindrical, adorned with rows of branching spines (see
Plate III, Figs. 23, 27, 31-33, 38).</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalids have the head more or less bifid.
There is a prominent thoracic tubercle, and a double row of
dorsal tubercles on the abdomen. Viewed from the back they
are more or less excavated on the sides of the thorax. In color
they are generally some shade of wood-brown or greenish.</p>

<p>The caterpillars feed for the most part upon the <i>Urticace&aelig;</i>,
plants of the nettle tribe, such as the stinging-nettle, the elm,
and the hop-vine, though the azalea and wild currants furnish
the food of some species.</p>

<p>The genus is confined mainly to the north temperate zone.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Grapta interrogationis</b>, Fabricius, Plate I, Fig. 3, [male],
<i>under side</i>; form <b>fabricii</b>, Edwards, Plate XIX, Fig. 1, [male]; form
umbrosa, Lintner, Plate XIX, Fig. 2, [female]; Plate III, Fig. 23, <i>larva</i>,
from a blown specimen; Fig. 27, <i>larva</i>, copied from a drawing
by Abbot; Plate IV, Figs. 21, 22, 24-26, 40, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Question-sign).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished by its large size, being the
largest species of the genus in our fauna. The fore wings are
decidedly falcate, or sickle-shaped, bright fulvous on the upper
side, spotted and bordered with dark brown and edged with pale
blue. On the under side they are mottled brown, shaded with
pale purplish, and have a silvery mark shaped like a semicolon
on the hind wings. The dimorphic variety <i>umbrosa</i>, Lintner, has
the upper side of the hind wings almost entirely black, except
at the base. Expanse, 2.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been frequently described, and the
reader who wishes to know all about the minute details of the
life-history will do well to consult the pages of Edwards and
Scudder, who have written voluminously upon the subject. The
food-plants are the elm, the hop-vine, and various species of nettles.</p>

<p>This is one of our commonest butterflies. It is double-brooded
in the Middle States. It hibernates in the imago form,
and when the first warm winds of spring begin to blow, it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[ 165]</a></span>
be found at the sap-pans in the sugar-camps, sipping the sweets
which drip from the wounded trunks of the maples. It ranges
all over the United States, except the Pacific coast, and is common
throughout Canada and Nova Scotia.</p>

IV, Figs. 27, 29, 30, 39, 46-48, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Comma Butterfly).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Dimorphic, in the form <i>dryas</i> with the hind wings
heavily suffused with black, in the form <i>harrisi</i> predominantly
fulvous. Expanse, 1.75-2.00 inches.</p>

<p>The caterpillars feed upon the <i>Urticace&aelig;</i>, and are very common
upon the nettle. They vary greatly in color, some being
almost snow-white. This species is found throughout Canada
and the adjacent provinces, and ranges south to the Carolinas and
Texas and over the Northwestern States.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Grapta satyrus</b>, Edwards, Plate XX, Fig. 1, &#9793;; Fig. 2, &#9793;,
<i>under side</i>; form <b>marsyas</b>, Edwards, Plate XIX, Fig. 14, &#9794;; Fig.
15, &#9794;, <i>under side</i>; Plate III, Fig. 33, <i>larva</i>; Plate IV, Figs. 41,
42, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Satyr).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The species is so accurately depicted in the plates
that a description is hardly necessary. The form <i>marsyas</i> is
smaller, brighter, and with the dark spots on the upper side of
the hind wings reduced in size. Expanse, 1.75-2.00 inches.</p>

<p>The food-plant of the caterpillar is the nettle. It occurs occasionally
in Ontario, and thence ranges west, being not uncommon
from Colorado to California and Oregon.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Grapta hylas</b>, Edwards, Plate XIX, Fig. 7, &#9794;; Fig. 8, &#9794;,
<i>under side</i> (The Colorado Angle-wing).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The butterfly closely resembles <i>G. silenus</i> on the
upper side, but may easily be distinguished by the uniform pale
purplish-gray of the lower side of the wings. Expanse, 2.00 inches.</p>

<p>The early stages are unknown. The insect has thus far been
found only in Colorado, but no doubt occurs in other States of
the Rocky Mountain region.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Grapta faunus</b>, Edwards, Plate XIX, Fig. 12, &#9794;; Fig. 13,
&#9794;, <i>under side</i>; Plate III, Fig. 32, <i>larva</i>; Plate IV, Figs. 31, 33-35,
<i>chrysalis</i> (The Faun).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is readily recognized by the deep
indentations of the hind wings, the heavy black border, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[ 166]</a></span>
dark tints of the under side mottled with paler shades. Expanse,
2.00-2.15 inches.</p>

<p>The caterpillar feeds on willows. It is found from New England
to the Carolinas, and thence westward to the Pacific.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Grapta zephyrus</b>, Edwards, Plate XX, Fig. 5, &#9794;; Fig. 6,
&#9794;, <i>under side</i> (The Zephyr).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Fulvous, marked with yellowish toward the outer
margins, the dark markings upon which are not as heavy as in
the other species of the genus. On the under side the wings are
paler than is the case in other species, reddish-brown, marbled with
darker brown lines and frecklings. Expanse, 1.75-2.00 inches.</p>

<p>The caterpillar, which feeds upon <i>Azalea occidentalis</i>, is described
and figured by Edwards in "The Butterflies of North
America," vol. i. <i>Zephyrus</i> is found throughout the region of
the Rocky Mountains, from Colorado to California, and from
Oregon to New Mexico.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Grapta gracilis</b>, Grote and Robinson, Plate XIX, Fig. 10,
&#9794;; Fig. 11, &#9793;, <i>under side</i> (The Graceful Angle-wing).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;A small species, rather heavily marked with dark
brown or blackish on the upper side. The wings on the under
side are very dark, crossed about the middle by a pale-gray or
white band shading off toward the outer margins. This light
band serves as a means of easily identifying the species. Expanse,
1.75 inch.</p>

<p>The early stages are unknown.</p>

<p>The species has been found on the White Mountains in New
Hampshire, in Maine, Canada, and British America, as far west
as Alaska.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Grapta silenus</b>, Edwards, Plate XIX, Fig. 5, &#9794;; Fig. 6,
&#9793;, <i>under side</i> (Silenus).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Larger than <i>gracilis</i>, and the wings more deeply
excised, as in <i>faunus</i>. On the under side the wings are very
dark, with lighter irrorations, especially on the fore wings. Expanse,
2.00-2.30 inches.</p>

<p>The early stages have never been studied. This species
appears to be found only in Oregon, Washington, and British
Columbia.</p>

<p>(9) <b>Grapta progne</b>, Cramer, Plate XX, Fig. 3, &#9794;; Fig. 4, &#9794;,
<i>under side</i>; Plate III, Fig. 31, <i>larva</i>; Plate IV, Figs. 32, 37, 38,
<i>chrysalis</i> (Progne).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[ 167]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;A rather small species, with light-fulvous fore
wings, shading into yellow toward the outer margins; the dark
markings slight, but deep in color. The secondaries are heavily
bordered with black on the outer margin. On the under side the
wings are very dark, variegated with paler shades, somewhat as in
<i>G. gracilis</i>. Expanse, 1.85-2.00 inches.</p>

<p>The early stages have been quite fully described by various
authors, and the reader may consult "The Butterflies of New
England," vol. i, pp. 266-268, for a full account. The caterpillar
feeds on the elm, but more commonly on various species of the
<i>Grossulace&aelig;</i>, or currant tribe, wild or domesticated. It ranges
from Siberia to Nova Scotia, and southward as far as Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>There are several other species of <i>Grapta</i> found in our fauna,
which are not delineated in this book; but they are rare species,
of which little is as yet known. The types are in the collection
of the writer, and if the reader finds any species which he cannot
identify by means of this book the author will be pleased to help
him to the full extent of his ability.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus VANESSA, Fabricius</b>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 96.</a>&mdash;Neuration
of the genus
<i>Vanessa</i>.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Medium-sized insects, the wings on the upper
side generally some shade of black or brown, marked with
red, yellow, or orange. The head is moderately
large, the eyes hairy, the palpi more
or less heavily scaled, the prothoracic legs feeble
and hairy. The lower discocellular vein
of the fore wings, when present, unites with
the third median nervule, not at its origin, but
beyond on the curve. The cell of the primaries
may or may not be closed. The cell of the secondaries
is open. The fore wings have the outer margin
more or less deeply excavated between the
extremities of the upper radial and the first median,
at which points the wings are rather strongly
produced. The hind wings have the outer margin denticulate,
strongly produced at the extremity of the third median nervule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[ 168]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Short, ovoid, broad at the base, tapering toward the
summit, which is broad and adorned with a few narrow, quite
high longitudinal ridges, increasing in height toward the apex.
Between these ribs are a few delicate cross-lines. They are
generally laid in large clusters upon twigs of the food-plant.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar moults four times. In the mature
form it is cylindrical, the segments adorned with long,
branching spines arranged in longitudinal rows; the spines much
longer, and branching rather than beset with bristles, as in the
genus <i>Grapta</i>. It lives upon elms, willows, and poplars.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis in general appearance is not unlike
the chrysalis of <i>Grapta</i>.</p>

<p>The genus is mainly restricted to the north temperate zone
and the mountain regions of tropical lands adjacent thereto.
The insects hibernate in the imago form, and are among the first
butterflies to take wing in the springtime.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Vanessa j-album</b>, Boisduval and Leconte, Plate XIX,
Fig. 9, &#9793; (The Compton Tortoise).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;No description is required, as the figure in the
plate will enable it to be immediately recognized. On the under
side of the wings it resembles in color the species of the genus
<i>Grapta</i>, from which the straight edge of the inner margin of
the primaries at once distinguishes it. It is a very close ally of
the European <i>V. vau-album</i>. Expanse, 2.60-2.75 inches.</p>

<p>The caterpillar feeds upon various species of willow. It is a
Northern form, being found in Pennsylvania upon the summits of
the Alleghanies, and thence north to Labrador on the east and
Alaska on the west. It is always a rather scarce insect.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Vanessa californica</b>, Boisduval, Plate XX, Fig. 11, &#9794;
(The California Tortoise-shell).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;On the upper side deep fulvous, mottled with yellow,
spotted and bordered with black. On the under side dark
brown; pale on the outer half of the primaries, the entire surface
marked with dark lines and fine stri&aelig;. Expanse, 2.00-2.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The larva and chrysalis have been described
by Henry Edwards in the "Proceedings of the California Academy
of Sciences," vol. v, p. 171. The caterpillar feeds upon
<i>Ceanothus thyrsiflorus</i>.</p>

<p>This insect is a close ally of the European <i>V. xanthomelas</i>.
It ranges from Colorado to California and as far north as Oregon.</p>

III, Fig. 36, <i>larva</i>; Plate IV, Figs. 43, 49, 50, <i>chrysalis</i> (Milbert's
Tortoise-shell).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished by the broad yellow submarginal
band on both wings, shaded outwardly by red. It is nearly
related to the European <i>V. urtic&aelig;</i>. Expanse, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p>The life-history has been worked out and described by numerous
writers. The caterpillars feed upon the nettle (<i>Urtica</i>).</p>

<p>This pretty little fly ranges from the mountains of West Virginia
northward to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, thence westward
to the Pacific.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Vanessa antiopa</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate I, Fig. 6, &#9793;; Plate
III, Fig. 28, <i>larva</i>; Plate IV, Figs. 51, 58, 59, <i>chrysalis</i> (The
Mourning-cloak; The Camberwell Beauty).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This familiar insect needs no description. It is
well known to every boy in the north temperate zone. It is one
of the commonest as well as one of the most beautiful species of
the tribe. A rare aberration in which the yellow border invades
the wing nearly to the middle, obliterating the blue spots, is sometimes
found. The author has a fine example of this "freak."</p>

<p>The eggs are laid in clusters upon the twigs of the food-plant
in spring (see p. 5, Fig. 11). There are at least two broods
in the Northern States. The caterpillars feed on willows, elms,
and various species of the genus <i>Populus</i>.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus PYRAMEIS, Doubleday</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings in their neuration approach closely to
the preceding genus, but are not angulate, and the ornamentation
of the under side tends to become ocellate, or marked
by eye-like spots, and in many of the species is ocellate.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is broadly ovoid, being much like the egg of the
genus <i>Vanessa</i>.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar in its mature form is covered with
spines, but these are not relatively as large as in <i>Vanessa</i>, and are
not as distinctly branching.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis approaches in outline the chrysalis of
the preceding genus, and is only differentiated by minor structural
peculiarities.</p>

<p>The genus includes only a few species, but some of them have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[ 170]</a></span>
a wide range, <i>Pyrameis cardui</i> being almost cosmopolitan, and

<p>This familiar butterfly, which is found
throughout North America, Europe, northern
Asia, and Africa, needs no description beyond
what is furnished in the plates. Expanse, 2.00

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This is undoubtedly the most widely distributed
of all known butterflies, being found in almost all parts of the
temperate regions of the earth and in many tropical lands in both
hemispheres. It is easily distinguished from the preceding species
by the more numerous and much smaller eye-like spots on
the under side of the hind wings. Expanse, 2.00-2.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been again and again described at
great length and with minute particularity by a score of authors.
The food-plants of the caterpillar are thistles (<i>Carduus</i>), <i>Urtica</i>,
<i>Cnicus</i>, and <i>Alth&aelig;a</i>.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Pyrameis cary&aelig;</b>, H&uuml;bner, Plate XX, Fig. 12, &#9794; (The

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is easily distinguished from <i>P. cardui</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[ 171]</a></span>
its nearest ally, by the absence of the roseate tint peculiar to that
species, the tawnier ground-color of the upper surfaces, and the
complete black band which crosses the middle of the cell of the
primaries. Expanse, 2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have not all been thoroughly described,
but we have an account of the larva and chrysalis from the pen
of Henry Edwards, in the "Proceedings of the California Academy
of Sciences," vol. v, p. 329. The food-plant of the caterpillar
is <i>Lavatera assurgentiflora</i>. This species ranges from Vancouver's
Island to Argentina, and is found as far east as Utah.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>WIDELY DISTRIBUTED BUTTERFLIES</b></p>

<p>The primal curse declared that the earth, because of man's
sin, should bring forth thorns and thistles, and thistles are almost
everywhere. Wherever thistles grow, there is found the thistle-butterfly,
or the "Painted Lady," as English collectors are in the
habit of calling it, <i>Pyrameis cardui</i>. All over Europe, all over
North America, in Africa,&mdash;save in the dense jungles of the Congo,&mdash;throughout
South America, in far-off Australia, and in many of
the islands of the sea this beautiful butterfly is found. At some
times it is scarce, and then again there are seasons when it fairly
swarms, every thistle-top having one of the gaily colored creatures
seated upon its head, and among the thorny environment
of the leaves being found the web which the caterpillar weaves.
Another butterfly which bids fair ultimately to take possession of
the earth is our own <i>Anosia plexippus</i>, the wanderings of which
have already been alluded to.</p>

<p>Many species are found in the arctic regions both of the Old
World and the New. Obscure forms are these, and lowly in their
organization, survivors of the ice-age, hovering on the borderline
of eternal frost, and pointing to the long-distant time when
the great land-masses about the northern pole were knit together,
as geologists teach us.</p>

<p>One of the curious phenomena in the distribution of butterflies
is the fact that in Florida we find <i>Hypolimnas misippus</i>, a species
which is exceedingly common in Africa and in the Indo-Malayan
subregion. Another curious phenomenon of a like character is
the presence in the Canary Islands of a <i>Pyrameis</i>, which appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[ 172]</a></span>
to be only a subvariety of the well-known <i>Pyrameis indica</i>,
which is common in India, southern China, and Japan. Away
off in southeastern Africa, upon the peaks and foot-hills which
surround the huge volcanic masses of Kilima-Njaro, Kenia, and
Ruwenzori, was discovered by the martyred Bishop Hannington
a beautiful species of <i>Argynnis</i>, representing a genus nowhere
else found upon the continent of Africa south of Mediterranean
lands. Strange isolation this for a butterfly claiming kin to the
fritillaries that sip the sweets from clover-blossoms in the Bernese
Oberland, in the valleys of Thibet, and on the prairies of the
United States.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus JUNONIA, H&uuml;bner</b>

<b>(Peacock Butterflies),</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Medium-sized butterflies, with eye-like spots upon
the upper wings. Their neuration is very much like that of the butterflies
belonging to the genus <i>Pyrameis</i>, to which they are closely
allied. The eyes are naked, the fore feet are scantily
clothed with hair, and the lower discocellular
vein of the fore wing, when present, does not terminate
on the arch of the third median nervule before
its origin, as in the genus <i>Vanessa</i>, but immediately
at the origin of the third median nervule.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Broader than high, the top flattened,
marked by ten vertical ribs, very narrow, but not
very high. Between the ribs are a few delicate
cross-lines.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is cylindrical,
the segments being adorned with rows of branching
spines and longitudinally striped.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is arched on the dorsal surface and

<p>There are eighteen or more species which belong to this genus,
of which some are neotropical, but the greater number are found
in the tropical regions of the Old World. Three forms occur
within the limits of the United States, which have by some authors
been reckoned as distinct species, and by others are regarded
merely as varietal forms.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Junonia c&oelig;nia</b>, H&uuml;bner, Plate XX, Fig. 7, &#9793;; Plate III,
Figs. 29, 30, <i>larva</i>; Plate IV, Figs. 56, 57, 65-67, <i>chrysalis</i> (The
Buckeye).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The figure in the plate is far better than any verbal
description. On the under side the eye-like spots of the upper
side are reproduced, but are much smaller, especially on the hind
wings. There is much variety in the ground-color of the wings
on the under side. Some specimens are reddish-gray, and some
are quite heavily and solidly pinkish-red on the secondaries.
Expanse, 2.00-2.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is dark green.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is dark in color, longitudinally
striped, and adorned with branching spines, two of which are on
the head and point forward.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is generally pale wood-brown,
strongly arched on the dorsal and concave on the ventral side.
It always hangs at less than a right angle to the surface from
which it depends.</p>

<p>This is a very common butterfly in the Southern States,
ranging northward as far as New England, westward to the
Pacific, and southward to Colombia. The caterpillar feeds on
various species of plantain (<i>Plantago</i>), also <i>Gerardia</i> and <i>Antirrhinum</i>.
When I was a lad in western North Carolina these
insects fairly swarmed one summer; thousands of the caterpillars
could be found in worn-out fields, feeding on the narrow-leaved
plantain, and every fence-rail had one or more of their
chrysalids hanging from the under side. I have never seen such
multitudes of this species since then. The butterflies are quite
pugnacious, and will fight with other passing butterflies, dashing
forth upon them, and chasing them away.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Junonia lavinia</b>, Cramer, Plate XX, Fig. 8, &#9794; (Lavinia).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species may be distinguished by the more
rounded apex and the more deeply excavated outer margin of the
fore wings, and also by the decided elongation of the outer margin
of the hind wings at the end of the submedian vein. The wings
are paler on the upper side than in the preceding species, and the
eye-like spots much smaller. Expanse, 2.00 inches.</p>

<p>The early stages are not accurately known. The insect is
common in the Antilles and South America, but is only now and
then taken in the extreme southern parts of Texas.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Junonia genoveva</b>, Cramer, Plate XX, Fig. 9, &#9794; (Genoveva).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Much darker above than either of the two preceding
species. The transverse subapical band is pale yellow,
almost white; the ocelli of the wings are more as in <i>lavinia</i> than
in <i>c&oelig;nia</i>. Expanse, about 2.00 inches.</p>

<p>This form, if found at all in our fauna, is confined to the extreme
South. I have seen and possess some specimens reputed
to have come from Texas. The specimen figured in the plate
was taken in Jamaica, where this form is prevalent.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus ANARTIA, Doubleday</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The head is small; the eyes are round and prominent;
the tongue is long; the antenn&aelig; are relatively long, having
the club short, compressed, and pointed. The palpi have the
second joint thick, the third joint gradually tapering
and lightly clothed with scales. The fore
wings are rounded at the apex, and have the
outer and inner margins somewhat excavated.
The outer margin of the hind wings is sinuous,
produced at the end of the third median nervule.
The cell of the hind wing is open. The subcostal
nervules in the fore wing are remarkable
because of the tendency of the first and second to
fuse with the costal vein. The prothoracic feet of the
male are small and weak; of the female, stronger.</p>

<p>The butterflies are characterized by the dark-brown

generally glossed with rich blue or purple. On
the under side the markings are exceedingly variable and in most
cases very beautiful. The genus is characteristic of the neotropical
fauna, and there are over sixty species which have been described.
The males are said by Bates, to whom we are indebted for most
of our knowledge of these insects, to have the habit of congregating
about noon and in the early afternoon in moist places by
the banks of streams, returning toward nightfall to the haunts of
the females. In this respect they resemble club-men, who at the
same hours are generally to be found congregating where there is
something to drink. Only two species are found in our region,
and are confined to the hottest parts of Texas and Florida, ranging
thence southward over the Antilles and Central America as
far as Bolivia.</p>

well-developed club. The fore wings and the hind wings have
the cell open. In the fore wing the subcostal
vein, which has five branches,
emits the first nervule well before the

The third median nervule of the hind
wing is greatly produced and forms the
support of the long tail which adorns
this wing. Between the end of the submedian
vein and the first median nervule
is another lobe-like prolongation of the
outer margin of the wing. The butterflies
are characterized for the most part
by dark upper surfaces, with light under
surfaces marked with broad bands and
lines of varying intensity of color. They
are easily distinguished from the butterflies
of all other genera of the Nymphalid&aelig; by the remarkable

finely pointed club. The fore wings have stout costal and median
veins. The subcostal throws out five nervules, the first two
before the end of the cell, the third midway between the end of

of the Indo-Malayan and Ethiopian
regions. In some way one of the
most widely spread of these species,
which is found throughout the tropics
of Asia and Africa, has obtained lodgment
upon the soil of the New World,
and is occasionally found in Florida,
where it is by no means common. It
may be that it was introduced from Africa in the time of the
slave-trade, having been accidentally brought over by ship. That
this is not impossible is shown by the fact that the writer has,
on several occasions, obtained in the city of Pittsburgh specimens
of rare and beautiful tropical insects which emerged from chrysalids
that were found attached to bunches of bananas brought

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is suspended by
a stout cremaster; the abdominal segments are
rounded. On the middle of the dorsum is a prominent projecting
boss. The thorax is rounded. The head is rounded or slightly bifid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[ 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The caterpillars feed upon the leaves of various species of oak,
birch, willow, and linden. The eggs are laid upon the extreme
tip of the leaves, and the infant caterpillar, feeding upon the leaf
in immediate proximity to the point where it has been hatched,
attaches bits of bitten leaf by strands of silk
to the midrib, thus stiffening its perch and
preventing its curling as the rib dries. Out
of bits of leaves thus detached it constructs a
packet of material, which it moves forward
along the midrib until it has completed its
second moult. By this time winter begins
to come on, and it cuts away for itself the material of the leaf
on either side of the rib, from the tip toward the base, glues
the rib of the leaf to the stem by means of silk, draws together
the edges of the remaining portions of
the leaf, and constructs a tube-like hibernaculum,
or winter quarters, exactly
fitting the body, in which it passes the
winter.</p>

</div>

<p>There are a number of species of the
genus found in the United States, the
habits of which have been carefully studied, and they are among
our most interesting butterflies, several species being mimics of
protected species.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Basilarchia astyanax</b>, Fabricius, Plate XXII, Fig. 1, &#9794;;
Plate III, Figs. 17, 21, 25, larva; Plate IV, Figs. 12, 13, <i>chrysalis</i>
(The Red-spotted Purple).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This common but most beautiful species is sufficiently
characterized by the plate so far as the upper surface is
concerned. On the under side the wings are brownish, banded
with black on the margins; the lunules are on this side as above,
but the inner band of spots is red. There are two red spots at
the base of the fore wings, and four at the base of the hind wings.
The palpi are white below, and the abdomen is marked with a
lateral white line on each side. Expanse, 3.00-3.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg, which resembles somewhat closely that of
<i>B. disippus</i> (see p. 3, Fig. 1), is yellowish-green, gradually turning
dark brown as the time for the emergence of the caterpillar
approaches.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is so well delineated in Plate III,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[ 184]</a></span>
Fig. 17, as to obviate the necessity for a lengthy verbal description.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;What has been said of the caterpillar is also true
of the chrysalis (see Plate IV).</p>

<p>The larva feeds upon the willow, cherry, apple, linden (<i>Tilia</i>),
huckleberry, currant, and other allied shrubs and trees. The
butterfly is somewhat variable, and a number of varietal forms
have been described. It ranges generally over the United States
and southern Canada as far as the Rocky Mountain ranges in
the West, and is even said to occur at high elevations in Mexico.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Basilarchia arthemis</b>, Drury, Plate XXII, Fig. 4, &#9794;, form
<b>lamina</b>, Fabricius; Fig. 5, &#9794;, form <b>proserpina</b>, Edwards, Plate III,
Fig. 26, <i>larva</i>; Plate IV, Figs. 14, 23, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Banded Purple).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished in the form <i>lamina</i> from <i>astyanax</i>,
which in other respects it somewhat closely resembles, by
the broad white bands crossing both the fore wings and the hind
wings, and followed on the secondaries by a submarginal row of
red spots shading inwardly into blue. In the form <i>proserpina</i>
there is a tendency on the part of the white bands to become obsolete,
and in some specimens they do entirely disappear. The
likeness to <i>astyanax</i> in such cases is striking, and the main point
by which the forms may then be discriminated is the persistence
of the red spots on the upper side of the secondaries; but even
these frequently are obsolete. Expanse, 2.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is grayish-green, with "kite-shaped" cells.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;Greenish-or olive-brown, blotched with white
in its mature form, which is well represented in Plate III. It
feeds upon the willow, the hawthorn (<i>Crat&aelig;gus</i>), and probably
other plants.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The figure in Plate IV is sufficiently exact to obviate
the necessity for further description.</p>

<p>This beautiful insect ranges through northern New England
and New York, Quebec, Ontario, and the watershed of the
Great Lakes, spreading southward at suitable elevations into
Pennsylvania. I have taken it about Cresson, Pennsylvania, at an
elevation of twenty-five hundred feet above sea-level. It is not
uncommon about Meadville, Pennsylvania. The species appears
to be, like all the others of the genus, somewhat unstable and
plastic, or else hybridization is very frequent in this genus. Probably
all the species have arisen from a common stock.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XXII">Plate XXII.</a></span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[ 185]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <b>Basilarchia weidemeyeri</b>, Edwards, Plate XXII, Fig. 6,
&#9794; (Weidemeyer's Admiral).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Superficially like <i>arthemis</i>, but easily distinguished
by the absence of the lunulate marginal bands of blue on the
margins of the hind wings and by the presence of a submarginal
series of white spots on both wings. Expanse, 3.00
inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described by W.H. Edwards
in the "Canadian Entomologist," vol. xxiv, p. 107, and show
great likeness to the following species, <i>B. disippus</i>. The caterpillar
feeds upon cottonwood (<i>Populus</i>).</p>

<p>The insect is found on the Pacific slope and eastward to Montana,
Nebraska, and New Mexico.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Basilarchia disippus</b>, Godart, Plate VII, Fig. 4, &#9794;;
Plate III, Figs. 19, 22, 24, <i>larva</i>; Plate IV, Figs. 18-20, <i>chrysalis</i>
(The Viceroy).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species mimics <i>Anosia plexippus</i> in a remarkable
manner, as may be seen by referring to Plate VII. An aberration
in which the mesial dark transverse band on the secondaries
has disappeared was named <i>pseudodorippus</i> by Dr. Strecker.
The type is in the Mead collection, now belonging to the writer.
Expanse, 2.50-2.75 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have all been carefully studied by numerous
writers. The egg is depicted on p. 3, Fig. 1. The caterpillar
is shown on p. 8, as well as in Plate III.</p>

<p>The species ranges everywhere from southern Canada and
British America into the Gulf States.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Basilarchia hulsti</b>, Edwards, Plate VII, Fig. 5, &#9794; (Hulst's
Admiral).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This form is apparently a mimic of <i>Anosia berenice</i>.
The ground-color of the wings is not so bright as in <i>B. disippus</i>,
and the mesial band of the secondaries on the upper side is relieved
by a series of small whitish spots, one on each interspace.
The perfect insect can easily be distinguished by its markings.
Expanse, 2.50-2.60 inches. Thus far it is only known from Utah
and Arizona. The early stages have not been described.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Basilarchia lorquini</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXII, Fig. 3, &#9794;
(Lorquin's Admiral).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished from all the other species of
the genus by the yellowish-white bar near the end of the cell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[ 186]</a></span>
the fore wings and the reddish color of the apex and upper margin
of the same wings. Expanse, 2.25-2.75 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been partially described by Henry
Edwards, and minutely worked out by Dr. Dyar, for whose description
the reader may consult the "Canadian Entomologist,"
vol. xxiii, p. 172. The food-plant of the caterpillar is <i>Populus</i>,
willows, and the choke-cherry (<i>Prunus demissa</i>).</p>

<p>Besides the forms figured in our plates there is a species in
Florida named <i>floridensis</i> by Strecker, and subsequently <i>eros</i> by
Edwards, which is generally larger and much darker than <i>B. disippus</i>,
which it otherwise closely approximates.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Genus ADELPHA, H&uuml;bner</b><br />

<b>(The Sisters)</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This genus is very closely allied to the preceding,
and is the South American representative of <i>Basilarchia</i>. The
only difference which is noticeable structurally is in the fact that
the eyes are hairy, the palpi not so densely clothed with scales.
The prothoracic legs of the males are smaller
than in <i>Basilarchia</i>. The cell of the primaries
is very slightly closed by the lower discocellular
vein, which reaches the median a little beyond
the origin of the second median nervule.
The outer margin of the fore wing is rarely
excavated, as in <i>Basilarchia</i>, and the lower
extremity of the hind wing near the anal
angle is generally more produced than in the
last-mentioned genus.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The life-history of the genus
has not been carefully worked out, but an
account has been published recently of the
caterpillar of the only species found within
our fauna, which shows that, while in general
resembling the caterpillars of the genus <i>Basilarchia</i>,
the segments are adorned with more branching spines
and with short fleshy tubercles, giving rise to small clusters of
hairs.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 109.</a>&mdash;Neuration of
the genus <i>Adelpha</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The chrysalids are of peculiar form, with bifid heads and
broad wing-cases. They are generally brown in color, with metallic
spots. The only species in our fauna is confined to southern
California, Arizona, and Mexico.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Adelpha californica</b>, Butler, Plate XXII, Fig. 2, &#9793; (The
Californian Sister).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily recognized by the large subtriangular patch
of orange-red at the apex of the primaries. In its habits and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[ 188]</a></span>
manner of flight it closely resembles the species of the genus
<i>Basilarchia</i>. Expanse, 2.50-3.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;So far as is known to the writer, these have
not been described, except partially by Henry Edwards in the
"Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences," vol. v,
p. 171. The caterpillar feeds upon oaks.</p>

<p>The insect is found in California, Nevada, Arizona, and
Mexico.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus CHLORIPPE, Boisduval</b><br />

<b>(The Hackberry Butterflies)</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Small butterflies, generally some shade of fulvous,
marked with eye-like spots on the posterior margin of the
secondaries, and occasionally upon the outer margin of the
primaries, the fore wings as well as the hind
wings being in addition more or less strongly
spotted and banded with black. The eyes are
naked; the antenn&aelig; are straight, provided with a
stout, oval club; the palpi are porrect, the second
joint heavily clothed with hairs, the third joint
short, likewise covered with scales. The costal
vein of the fore wing is stout. The first subcostal
vein alone arises before the end of the cell. The
cell is open in both wings.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs, which are deposited in clusters,
are nearly globular, the summit broad and
convex. The egg is ornamented by from eighteen
to twenty rather broad vertical ribs, having no great elevation,
between which are numerous faint and delicate cross-lines.</p>

of the genus
<i>Clorippe</i>, &#9794;.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The head is subquadrate, with the summit
crowned by a pair of diverging stout coronal spines which have
upon them a number of radiating spinules. Back of the head, on
the sides, is a frill of curved spines. The body is cylindrical,
thickest at the middle, tapering forward and backward from this
point. The anal prolegs are widely divergent and elongated, as
in many genera of the <i>Satyrin&oelig;</i>.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is compressed laterally and keeled
on the dorsal side, concave on the ventral side, the head distinctly
bifid. The cremaster is very remarkable, presenting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[ 189]</a></span>
appearance of a flattened disk, the sides studded with hooks, by
means of which the chrysalis is attached to the surface, from
which it depends in such a manner that the ventral surface is
parallel to the plane of support.</p>

<p>The caterpillars feed upon the <i>Celtis</i>, or hackberry.</p>

<p>There are a number of species, mainly confined to the southwestern
portion of the United States, though some of them range
southward into Mexico. Two only are known in the Middle
States. The species are double-brooded in the more northern
parts of the country, and the caterpillars produced from eggs laid
by the second brood hibernate.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Chlorippe celtis</b>, Boisduval and Leconte, Plate XXIII,
Fig. 3, &#9794;; Fig. 4, &#9793;; Fig. 11, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (The Hackberry
Butterfly).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The primaries at the base and the secondaries
except at the outer angle pale olive-brown, the rest of the wings
black. The dark apical tract of the primaries is marked by two
irregular, somewhat broken bands of white spots. There is a
red-ringed eye-spot between the first and second median nervules,
near the margin of the fore wing, and there are six such
spots on each hind wing. On the under side the ground-color is
grayish-purple; the spots and markings of the upper side reappear
on this side.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female has the wings, as is always the case in this
genus, much broader and not so pointed at the apex of the primaries
as in the male sex, and the color is much paler. Expanse,
&#9794;, 1.80 inch; &#9793;, 2.10 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are beautifully described and delineated
by Edwards in "The Butterflies of North America," vol. ii.
The caterpillar feeds on the hackberry (<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>).</p>

<p>This species is found generally from southern Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. It is not, so
far as is known, found on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Chlorippe antonia</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIII, Fig. 12, &#9794;
(Antonia).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Bright yellowish-fulvous on the upper side.
Easily distinguished from <i>celtis</i> by the two eye-spots near the
margin of the primaries. Expanse, 1.75-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p><i>Antonia</i> is found in Texas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[ 190]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <b>Chlorippe montis</b>, Edwards, Plate XXII, Fig. 7, &#9794;; Fig.
8, &#9793; (The Mountain Emperor).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Very closely allied to <i>C. antonia</i> in the style and
location of the markings, but tinted with pale ashen-gray on the
upper side of the wings, and not yellowish-fulvous as in the last-named
species. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.75 inch; &#9793;, 2.15 inches.</p>

<p>The early stages are unknown.</p>

<p><i>Montis</i> occurs in Arizona and Colorado, and by some writers
is regarded as a varietal form of <i>antonia</i>, in which opinion they
may be correct.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Chlorippe leilia</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIII, Fig. 11, &#9794; (Leilia).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Like <i>antonia</i>, this species has two extra-median
eye-spots on the primaries, and thus may be distinguished from
<i>celtis</i>. From <i>antonia</i> it may be separated by its larger size and
the deeper reddish-brown color of the upper surfaces. Expanse,
2.10-2.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>So far we have received this butterfly only from Arizona.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Chlorippe alicia</b>, Plate XXIII, Fig. 9, &#9794;; Fig. 10, &#9793;
(Alicia).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Very bright fawn at the base of the wings, shading
into pale buff outwardly. There is but one eye-spot on the primaries.
The six eye-spots on the secondaries are black and very
conspicuous. The marginal bands are darker and heavier than
in any other species of the genus. Expanse, &#9794;, 2.00 inches;
&#9793;, 2.50 inches.</p>

<p>The early stages are only partially known.</p>

<p><i>Alicia</i> ranges through the Gulf States from Florida to
Texas.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Chlorippe clyton</b>, Boisduval and Leconte, Plate XXIII,
Fig. 5, &#9794;; Fig. 6, &#9793;; Plate III, Fig. 20, <i>larva</i>; Plate IV, Figs.
15-17, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Tawny Emperor).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The fore wings without an extra-median eye-spot,
and the secondaries broadly obscured with dark brown or
blackish, especially on the outer borders, so that the eye-spots
are scarcely, if at all, visible.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;Much larger and paler in color than the male, the eye-spots
on the secondaries conspicuous. Expanse, &#9794;, 2.00 inches;
&#9793;, 2.50-2.65 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The life-history has been carefully worked out,
and the reader who wishes to know all about it should consult the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[ 191]</a></span>
writings of Edwards and Scudder.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XXIII">Plate XXIII.</a></span></div>

<p>This species is occasionally found in New England, and ranges
thence westward to Michigan, and southward to the Gulf States.
It is quite common in the valley of the Ohio.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Chlorippe flora</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIII, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Fig.
2, &#9793; (Flora).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;The ground-color is bright reddish-fulvous on
the upper side. The usual markings occur, but there is no eye-spot,
or ocellus, on the primaries. The hind wings are not
heavily obscured with dark brown, as in <i>clyton</i>, and the six
ocelli stand forth conspicuously upon the reddish ground. The
hind wings are more strongly angulated than in any other
species. The borders are quite solidly black.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female is much larger than the male, and looks like a
very pale female of <i>clyton</i>. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.75 inch; &#9793;, 2.35 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The life-history has been described by Edwards
in the "Canadian Entomologist," vol. xiii, p. 81. The habits of
the insect in its early stages and the appearance of the larva and
chrysalis do not differ widely from those of <i>C. clyton</i>, its nearest ally.</p>

<p><i>Flora</i> is found in Florida and on the borders of the Gulf to
Texas.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus PYRRHAN&AElig;A, Schatz</b><br />

<b>(The Leaf-wings)</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Medium-sized butterflies, on the upper side of the
wings for the most part red or fulvous, on the under side of the
wings obscurely mottled on the secondaries and the costal and
apical tracts of the primaries in such a manner as to cause them to
appear on this side like rusty and faded leaves. Structurally they
are characterized by the somewhat falcate shape of the primaries
and the strongly produced outer margin of the secondaries about
the termination of the third median nervule. The first and second
subcostal nervules coalesce with one another and with the costal
vein. The costal margin of the fore wing at the base is strongly
angulated, and the posterior margin of the primaries is straight.
The cell of the secondaries is very feebly closed.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Spherical, flattened at the base and somewhat depressed
at the apex, with a few parallel horizontal series of raised points
about the summit.</p>


<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;Head somewhat globular in appearance; the anterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[ 192]</a></span>
portion of the first thoracic segment of the body is much
smaller in diameter than the head; the body
is cylindrical, tapering to a point.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;Short, stout, with transverse
ridges above the wings on the middle
of the abdomen, keeled on the sides. The
cremaster is small and furnished with a globular
tip, the face of which is on the same
plane as the ventral surface of the body,
causing the chrysalis to hang somewhat obliquely
from the surface which supports it.</p>

<p>This is a large genus of mostly tropical
species, possessed of rather singular habits.
The caterpillars in the early stages of their
existence have much the same habits as the
caterpillars of the genus <i>Basilarchia</i>, which
have been already described. After passing
the third moult they construct for themselves
nests by weaving the edges of a leaf together, and thus conceal
themselves from sight, emerging in the dusk to feed upon the
food-plant. They live upon the <i>Euphorbiace&aelig;</i>, the <i>Laurace&aelig;</i>, and
the <i>Piperace&aelig;</i>. The insects are double-brooded in the cooler
regions of the North, and are probably many-brooded in the
tropics.</p>

Goatweed Butterfly).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly</i>, &#9794;.&mdash;Solidly bright red above, the outer margins
narrowly dusky on the borders. On the under side the wings
are gray, dusted with brown scales, causing them to resemble
the surface of a dried leaf.</p>

<p>&#9793;.&mdash;The female has the upper side paler and marked by pale
fulvous bands, as shown in the plate. Expanse, &#9794;, 2.50 inches;
&#9793;, 3.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;In Fig. 21, on p. 9, is a good representation of
the mature caterpillar, the nest which it constructs for itself, and
the chrysalis. A full account of the life-history may be found
in the "Fifth Missouri Report" from the pen of the late C.V. Riley.
The caterpillar feeds on <i>Croton capitatum</i>.</p>

<p>The insect ranges from Illinois and Nebraska to Texas.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>FOSSIL INSECTS</b></p>

<p>Investigations within comparatively recent times have led to
the discovery of a host of fossil insects. A few localities in
Europe and in North America are rich in such remains, and the
number of species that have been described amounts to several
thousands. Strangely enough, some of these fossil insects are
very closely allied in form to species that are living at the present
time, showing the extreme antiquity of many of our genera. One
of the comparatively recent discoveries has been the fossil remains
of a butterfly which Dr. Scudder, who has described it, declares
to be very near to the African <i>Libythea labdaca</i>, which differs in
certain minor anatomical respects from the American Libytheas
which are figured in this work; and Dr. Scudder has therefore proposed
a new generic name, <i>Dichora</i>, meaning "an inhabitant of
two lands," which he applies to the African species because
related to the extinct American butterfly. The strange discoveries,
which have been made by pal&aelig;ontologists as to the
huge character of many of the mammals, birds, and reptiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[ 196]</a></span>
which at one time tenanted the globe, are paralleled by recent
discoveries made in insect-bearing strata in France. M. Charles
Brongniart of the Paris Museum is preparing an account of the
collection which he has made at Commentry, and among the
creatures which he proposes to figure is an insect which is
regarded by Brongniart as one of the forerunners of our dragon-flies,
which had an expanse of wing of two feet, a veritable giant
in the insect world.</p>

<p>Of fossil butterflies there have thus far been discovered sixteen
species. Of these, six belong to the subfamily of the <i>Nymphalid&aelig;</i>,
and five of the six were found in the fossiliferous strata of
Florissant, Colorado. Two species belong to the subfamily <i>Satyrin&aelig;</i>,
both occurring in deposits found in southern France, and
representing genera more nearly allied to those now found in
India and America than to the <i>Satyrin&aelig;</i> existing at the present
time in Europe. One of the fossils to which reference has already
been made belongs to the subfamily of the <i>Libythein&aelig;</i>.
The remainder represent the subfamilies of the <i>Pierin&aelig;</i>, the
<i>Papilionin&aelig;</i>, and the family <i>Hesperiid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the butterflies which have been found in
a fossil state show a very close affinity to genera existing at the
present time, for the most part, in the warmer regions of the
earth. Though ages have elapsed since their remains were
embedded in the mud which became transformed into stone,
the processes of life have not wrought any marked structural
changes in the centuries which have fled. This fixity of type
is certainly remarkable in creatures so lowly in their organization.</p>

<p>The butterflies belonging to this subfamily are, for the most
part, of medium size, and are generally obscure in color, being of
some shade of brown or gray, though a few species within our
territory are brightly colored. Gaily colored species belonging
to this subfamily are more numerous in the tropics of both hemispheres.
The wings are very generally ornamented, especially upon
the under side, by eye-like spots, dark, pupiled in the center
with a point of lighter color, and ringed around with one or
more light circles. They are possessed of a weak flight, flitting
and dancing about among herbage, and often hiding among the
weeds and grasses. Most of them are forest-loving insects,
though a few inhabit the cold and bleak summits of mountains
and grassy patches near the margins of streams in the far North,
while some are found on the treeless prairies of the West. In
the warmer regions of the Gulf States a few species are found
which have the habit of flitting about the grass of the roadsides
and in open spaces about houses. The veins of the fore wings
are generally greatly swollen at the base, enabling them thus to
be quickly distinguished from all other butterflies of this family.</p>

<p>The eggs, so far as we have knowledge of them, are subspher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[ 198]</a></span>ical,
somewhat higher than broad, generally ribbed along the
sides, particularly near the apex, and rounded at the base, which
is generally broader than the apex.</p>

<p>The caterpillars at the time of emergence from the egg have
the head considerably larger than the remainder of the body; but
when they have reached maturity they are cylindrical, tapering a
little from the middle to either end. They are bifurcated at the
anal extremity, a character which enables them to be distinguished
at a glance from the larv&aelig; of all other American butterflies
except those of the genus <i>Chlorippe</i>. They are mostly pale
green or light brown in color, ornamented with stripes along
the sides. They feed upon grasses and sedges, lying in concealment
during the daytime, and emerging at dusk to take their
nourishment.</p>

<p>The chrysalids are rather stout in form, but little angulated,
and without any marked prominences or projections. They are
green or brown in color. Most of them are pendant, but a few
forms pupate at the roots of grasses or under stones lying upon
the ground.</p>

<p>The butterflies of this subfamily have been arranged, so far
as they are represented in the faunal region of which this book
treats, in nine genera, which include about sixty species. It is
quite possible that a number of species still remain to be discovered
and described, though it is also true that some of the so-called
species are likely to prove in the end little more than local
races or varieties.</p>

the fore wing is thickened, but not greatly swollen.
The first and second subcostals are emitted well
before the end of the cell, the third beyond it, and
the fourth and fifth from a common stem, both

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Upon the upper side the wings are pale mouse-gray,
with a couple of twinned black spots on the outer margin
of the hind wings. On the under side the wings are reddish-gray,
marked with irregular ferruginous lines. Near the outer
margin of the hind wings is a row of silvered spots, the spots
corresponding in location to the dark marginal spots being expanded
into a violet patch marked in the middle by a twinned
black spot centered with silver. Expanse, 1.25-1.35 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been beautifully described and figured
by Edwards in the third volume of "The Butterflies of
North America."</p>

<p>The egg is somewhat globular, rather higher than wide, flattened
at the base, and marked with numerous shallow reticulated
depressions. The caterpillar of the spring brood is pale green,
of the fall brood pale brown, marked respectively with numerous
longitudinal stripes of darker green or brown. It has two long,
elevated, horn-like projections upon the head, and on the anal
segment two similar projections pointing straight backward.
The chrysalis is small, green, or brown, strongly bifid at the
head. The caterpillar feeds on grasses.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Mr. Edwards has figured the egg, which is
different in shape from that of the preceding species, being
broader than high, subglobular, flattened broadly at the base,
green in color, and almost devoid of sculpturings upon its surface.
Of the other stages we know nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[ 203]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side is immaculate gray; beneath
pale, with two ferruginous transverse lines. Between these
lines is a ferruginous line on each wing, rudely describing a circle.
In the circle on the fore wing are three or four eye-spots with a
blue pupil and a yellow iris; in the circle on the hind wing are
six eye-spots which are oblong and have the pupil oval. Expanse,
1.25 inch.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished from the other species of the
genus by the eye-spots on the under side of the wings, four on
each of the primaries and six on each of the secondaries, arranged
in a straight series on the outer third, well removed from the
margin. These spots are black, ringed about with yellow and
pupiled with blue.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The species is local, and thus far is recorded only from
northern New Jersey, near Lake Hopatcong, and the State of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[ 204]</a></span>
Michigan. No doubt it occurs elsewhere, but has been overlooked
by collectors.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Neonympha sosybius</b>, Fabricius, Plate XXV, Fig. 5, &#9794;,
<i>under side</i> (The Carolinian Satyr).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper surface is immaculate dark mouse-gray.
On the under side the wings are paler, with three
transverse undulatory lines, one defining the basal, the other
the median area, and one just within the margin. Between the
last two are rows of ocelli. The spots in these rows are obscure,
except the first on the primaries and the second and last two on
the secondaries, which are black, ringed about with yellow and
pupiled with blue.</p>

<p>The female is like the male, but a trifle larger.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described by Edwards,
French, and Scudder, and do not differ strikingly from those of
other species.</p>

<p>The species ranges from the latitude of New Jersey southward,
throughout the southern half of the Mississippi Valley to
Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Neonympha rubricata</b>, Edwards, Plate XXV, Fig. 3, &#9794;
(The Red Satyr).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished by its much redder color
from all its congeners, among which it has its closest ally in
<i>N. eurytus</i>. It has an eye-spot near the apex of the fore wing,
and one near the anal angle of the hind wing. The basal area of
the primaries beneath is bright reddish; the secondaries on this
side are gray, crossed by two transverse lines as in the preceding
species, and a double submarginal line. On the fore wings the
double submarginal line is repeated, and in addition there is
another line which runs upward from just before the inner angle
to the costa, at about one third of its length from the apex. The
eye-spots of the upper side reappear below, and in addition there
is another near the outer angle of the secondaries, and a few silvery
well-defined ocelli between the two on the secondaries.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The Red Satyr is found in Texas, Arizona, Mexico, and Central
America.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This little species is to be distinguished from its
near allies by its white color. The form <i>galactinus</i> is the winter
form; the form <i>california</i> the summer form. The former is
characterized by the darker color of the hind wings on the under

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings on the upper side are ochreous-brown,
lighter on the disk. The costal margin of the fore wings
and the outer margin of both fore and hind wings are gray.
The ocellus at the apex of the fore wings on the under side is
faintly visible on the upper side. On the under side the fore
wings are colored as on the upper side as far as the termination
of the discal area, which is marked by a narrow transverse band
of pale yellow, followed by a conspicuous ocellus. The hind
wings are gray, darkest toward the base, behind the irregular
whitish transverse band which crosses the outer portion of the
disk.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The species occurs in Montana, Minnesota, British America,
and Newfoundland. Newfoundland specimens, of which I
possess a large series, are distinctly darker in color than those
taken in the Northwest. Some recent writers are inclined to
regard this as a variety of the European <i>C. typhon</i>. I am persuaded
that they are mistaken.</p>

found in North America. Easily distinguished by the marginal
row of ocelli on the secondaries, which are always present,
though often "blind," that is to say, without a distinct dark
pupil. The author of the species named it from a supposed
likeness to the European <i>C. pamphilus</i>. The resemblance is only
superficial. <i>C. pamphilus</i> is a much smaller insect and much
more plainly marked, judging from the large series of specimens
I have received from various European localities. <i>Pamphilus</i> has
no eye-spots on the hind wings. They are a conspicuous feature

it intersects the union of the middle and
lower discocellular veins. The outer margins
of both wings are evenly rounded.</p>

surrounded by a few strands of silk. The chrysalis is convex,
both ventrally and dorsally, humped on the thorax, produced at
the head; all the projections well rounded. The chrysalids are
generally some shade of light brown or ashen-gray, with darker
stripes and spots. This genus is arctic, and only found in the
cooler regions of the North or upon elevated mountain summits.
A few species range downward to lower levels in more temperate
climates, but these are exceptional cases.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Erebia disa</b>, var. <b>mancinus</b>, Doubleday and Hewitson,
Plate XXV, Fig. 23, &#9794; (The Alaskan Alpine).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings are dark brown on the upper side.
On the outer third below the apex are three or four black ocelli,
broadly ringed with red and pupiled with white. The upper
ocellus is generally bipupiled, that is to say, the black spot is
twinned, and there are two small light spots in it. On the
under side the fore wings are as on the upper side. The hind
wings are broadly sown with gray scales, giving them a hoary
appearance. The base is more or less gray, and there is a broad,
regularly curved mesial band of dark gray, which in some specimens
is very distinct, in others more or less obsolete. The
female does not differ from the male, except that the ocelli on
the fore wings are larger and more conspicuous.</p>

outer third of the fore wings. At the apical end of this band are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[ 210]</a></span>
two black ocelli, pupiled with white. The fore wings on the
under side are reddish, with the costa and outer margin grayish.
The ocelli on this side are as on the upper side. The hind wings
are gray, dusted with brown scales and crossed by narrow, irregular,
dark-brown subbasal, median, and submarginal lines.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This species is not uncommon on the high mountains of
Colorado and New Mexico. It is regarded as a variety of the
European <i>E. tyndarus</i>, Esper, by many. All the specimens of
<i>tyndarus</i> in my collection, and there are many, lack the ocelli on
the fore wing, or they are very feebly indicated on the under

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings are dark brown on the upper side, with
four or five black ocelli, pupiled with white and broadly surrounded
by red near the outer margin of the fore wings, and
with three or four similar ocelli located on the upper side of
the hind wings. The spots on the upper side reappear on the
under side, and in addition the hind wings are covered by a
broad curved median blackish band.</p>

spots on the secondaries, the last two of the latter somewhat
distant from each other and from the first three, which are
nearer the outer angle. On the under side the primaries are
reddish, with the submarginal band as on the upper side, but
paler. On the secondaries, which are a little paler below than
above, the spots of the upper side are repeated, but they are
yellowish-white, standing forth conspicuously upon the darker
ground-color.</p>

rounded, and the costal margin quite strongly produced, or bent
at an angle, just above the origin of the costal vein. The
inner margin is straight. The costal vein of the fore wing is
slightly swollen. The costal margin at the extremity of the
second costal nervule is slightly bent inward;
the upper discocellular vein is
wanting; the lower radial vein is emitted
from the lower discocellular a little
below the point at which it unites with
the middle discocellular. The middle
discocellular of the hind wing appears
as an inward continuation of the lower
radial for some distance, when it bends
upward suddenly to the origin of the
upper radial. The head is small; the antenn&aelig;
are short, with a thin, gradually
developed club; the palpi are slender,
compressed, well clothed with long hairs
below.</p>

base than at the top, with the summit rounded. The sides are
ornamented with fourteen or fifteen vertical raised ridges, which
are quite broad, and sometimes fork or run into each other. On
the sides these ridges seem to be regularly excised at their bases,
and between them on the surface are many horizontal raised
cross-lines, giving the depressed surface the appearance of being

earth; it is rounded, somewhat carinate, or keel-shaped, where
the wing-cases unite on the ventral side. The head is rounded,
the thorax strongly arched, the dorsal side of the abdomen very
convex. On either side of the head are small clusters of fine
processes shaped somewhat like an Indian club, the thickened
part studded with little spur-like projections. These can only
be seen under the microscope.</p>

The under side is paler than the upper side, and the basal and median
areas of both wings are profusely mottled with narrow pale-brown
stri&aelig;, the secondaries crossed by a darker mesial band, the
outer margin of which is sharply indented. Expanse, 1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Distinguished from the preceding species by the
larger and paler submarginal markings on the upper side of the

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Butterflies of medium size, their wings marked with
eye-like spots, or ocelli. Upon the upper surface they are generally
obscurely colored of some shade of gray or brown,
occasionally marked with bands of yellow. On

striated and spotted, with the eye-like spots more
prominent. The costal vein at the base is greatly
swollen; the median and submedian veins less
so. The first and second subcostal nervules

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Short, barrel-shaped, greatly diminishing in size on

<p>This genus includes numerous species which are more or less
subject to varietal modifications. In the following pages I have
treated as species a number of forms which by some writers are
reckoned as mere varieties. Whether the view of those who
regard these forms in the light of varieties is correct is not perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[ 215]</a></span>
plain to me, and we cannot be sure until more extensive
experiments in breeding have been carried out.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Satyrus pegala</b>, Fabricius, Plate XXVI, Fig. 18, &#9793;, <i>under
side</i> (The Southern Wood-nymph).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The largest species of the genus in our fauna,
easily recognized by the broad yellow submarginal band on the
primaries, marked with a single eye-spot in the male and two
eye-spots in the female. The plate gives a correct idea of the
under side of the wings. Expanse, 2.75 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have only been partially ascertained.
The caterpillar, like all others of the genus, feeds on grasses.</p>

<p>This insect is found in the Gulf States and as far north as
New Jersey, and is probably only a large Southern form of the
next species.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Satyrus alope</b>, Fabricius, Plate XXVI, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Fig. 2,
&#9793;; Plate III, Fig. 18, <i>larva</i> (The Common Wood-nymph).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Closely resembling the preceding species, but only
two thirds of its size. The figures in our plate give a correct
idea of its appearance. The number of the ocelli is not constant,
and occasionally specimens occur in which they are almost wanting.
Several varietal forms have been described: <i>S. maritima</i>, from
Long Island and Martha's Vineyard, in which the wings are
smaller, the band inclined to orange-yellow, and the upper side
of the wings is darker than in the typical form; and <i>S. texana</i>,
from the extreme South, in which the ground-color of the wings
is paler brown, the yellow band ochreous, and the spots on the
under side of the hind wings larger than in the other forms.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Satyrus alope</b>, form <b>nephele</b>, Kirby, Plate XXVI, Fig. 3,
&#9794;; Fig. 4, &#9793;, <i>under side</i>; Plate IV, Figs. 7, 8, <i>chrysalis</i> (The
Clouded Wood-nymph).</p>

<p>This varietal form of <i>S. alope</i>, long held to be a species, but
now known to be a dimorphic variety, is characterized by the
partial or entire suppression of the yellow band on the primaries
and the tendency of the eye-spots to become obsolete. It is the
Northern form of the species, and is found in Canada, New England,
and on the continent generally, from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, north of the latitude of central New York and southward
on the mountain masses of the Appalachian ranges.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Satyrus alope</b>, form <b>olympus</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVI,
Fig. 9, &#9794;; Fig. 10, &#9793;, <i>under side</i> (Olympus).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[ 216]</a></span></p>

<p>This form of <i>S. alope</i> is common in the region west of the
Mississippi. The males are a trifle darker and the females a
shade paler than in the form <i>nephele</i>, which they closely approximate,
and from which it would almost be impossible to separate
them without a knowledge of the country whence they come.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>Satyrus alope</b>, form <b>ariane</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXVI, Fig.
5, &#9794;; Fig. 6, &#9793;, <i>under side</i> (Ariane).</p>

<p>In <i>ariane</i> we have a decidedly dwarfed form, in which the
males and the females are quite dark. The ocelli, though small,
are persistent, well defined, rarely showing a tendency to disappear
completely. This form is found in British America, Oregon,
and the northwestern portion of the United States.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <b>Satyrus baroni</b>, Plate XXVI, Fig. 15, &#9794;; Fig. 16, &#9794;,
<i>under side</i> (Baron's Satyr).</p>

<p>This is another form, dark on the upper side and reddish
below, in which the ocelli on the under side show a tendency to
become obsolete, and in some specimens are wholly wanting.</p>

<p>There are other varietal forms, one of which, named <i>bo&ouml;pis</i>
by Behr, is commonly found on the Pacific coast in northern
California, Oregon, and Washington, and the ocelli, while prominent
on the upper side of the wings, are almost obsolete below.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The early stages of <i>S. alope</i> (typical form)
and its variety <i>nephele</i> have been well described by several
authors. The caterpillar feeds on grasses. There is, however,
a fine field for the entomologist to work out the causes of the
rather remarkable variation to which the species is subject.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Satyrus gabbi</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVI, Fig. 17, &#9793;, <i>under
side</i> (Gabb's Satyr).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male is dark reddish-brown, the female pale
fawn. The ocelli in both sexes are very well developed on both
sides of the wings. The anal series on the secondaries consists
of three spots, of which the one in the middle is always large.
Expanse, 2.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>Gabb's Satyr is found in Oregon and Utah.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Satyrus meadi</b>, Plate XXVI, Fig. 13, &#9793;; Fig. 14, &#9794;,
<i>under side</i> (Mead's Satyr).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This well-marked species is comparatively small,
and may easily be distinguished from all others by the bright red
on the limbal area above and on the middle area of the primaries
below. Expanse, 1.60-1.75 inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[ 217]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described and figured by
Edwards in "The Butterflies of North America," vol. iii. The
caterpillar is green, marked by paler stripes and lozenge-shaped
spots of pale green on the side. The chrysalis is pale green.
The egg is pale saffron. The caterpillars feed on grass.</p>

<p>Mead's Satyr ranges through Colorado, Montana, Utah, and
Arizona.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Satyrus paulus</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVI, Fig. 19, &#9794;, <i>under
side</i> (The Small Wood-nymph).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;A little smaller than <i>S. nephele</i>, dark brown above
in both sexes, the fore wings always with two pupilate ocelli,
one near the apex, the other near the inner angle, most conspicuously
developed in the female. The secondaries have one or
two spots of the same kind near the anal angle. On the under
side the wings are pale reddish-brown, abundantly marked by
transverse stri&aelig;. The primaries are marked with gray at the
apex and on the outer margin, and have a submarginal and submedian
transverse ferruginous line, between which the ocelli are
located. The secondaries are crossed by a broad darker median
band defined inwardly and outwardly by narrow dark lines. The
outer third is pale gray, mottled with darker spots and lines, and
traversed by a dark ferruginous submarginal line. Expanse,
1.75-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p><i>Paulus</i> occurs in California and Nevada. It has been regarded
as a variety of <i>sthenele</i> by some writers; but I am convinced of
its distinctness, though there is considerable resemblance.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Satyrus charon</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVI, Fig. 11, &#9794;; Fig.
12, &#9793; (The Dark Wood-nymph).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male is dark in color; the female is paler.
There are two eye-spots on the fore wings in the usual location,
indistinct on the upper, distinct on the lower side of the wings.
The under sides of the wings are variable. In the type they are
dark; in other specimens they are paler. They may or may not
have ocelli on the secondaries. The form with obsolescent
ocelli has been named <i>silvestris</i> by Edwards. Both the fore and
hind wings are abundantly and evenly marked by little stri&aelig;, and
crossed on either side of the median area by obscure, irregular,
transverse dark lines, either one or both of which may be wanting
in some specimens. Expanse, 1.50-1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described and beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[ 218]</a></span>
figured by Edwards in the third volume of his great work, to
which the reader may refer. The caterpillar is green, cylindrical,
tapering before and behind, marked with longitudinal pale-yellow
lines. The chrysalis is green or black, striped with narrow white
lines. The egg is somewhat firkin-shaped, flat at the top and base,
vertically ribbed, and honey-yellow. The larva feeds on grasses.</p>

<p><i>Charon</i> is found in the Northwest, ranging from British
Columbia as far as New Mexico.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Satyrus &oelig;tus</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXVI, Fig. 7, &#9794;; Fig. 8,
&#9794;, <i>under side</i> (Boisduval's Satyr).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Larger than <i>charon</i>, paler on the upper side,
especially in the female sex, in which the outer third of the primaries
is reddish-fawn. On the under side the secondaries of
the male are without ocelli, or at most faint traces of ocelli appear.
In the female the ocelli near the anal angle of the secondaries
are usually well developed. Expanse, 1.60-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These await description.</p>

<p>The species is found in northern California.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Satyrus sthenele</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXVI, Fig. 20, &#9794;,
<i>under side</i> (The Least Wood-nymph).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Quite small, superficially resembling <i>charon</i>. The
female is paler and the ocelli are larger and more distinct than in
<i>charon</i>. The distinguishing mark of this species is the irregular,
dark, twice-strangulated band of the secondaries, bordered on
both sides externally by whitish shades. This is shown in our
figure. Expanse, 1.40-1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The species is Californian.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; are short; the eyes of moderate size;
the front full, protuberant; the palpi slender; the fore wings
somewhat produced at the tip, with the outer margins rounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[ 219]</a></span>
and the hind margins very slightly, if at all, sinuated. The nervules
of the fore wings are slightly dilated toward the base; the
hind wings are elongated, oval, with the
outer margins evenly rounded. The color
of these butterflies is some shade of
brown; the outer margin is generally
lighter than the base of the wing, and is
marked with black spots, sometimes pupiled
with white. The wings are generally
marbled and mottled on the underside,
and sometimes crossed on the middle
of the hind wings by a broad band of
darker color. The fringes are brown,
checkered with white.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is ovate-spherical,
higher than broad, marked on the side
from the apex to the base with raised
sculptured ridges. These eggs are deposited,
so far as we have been able to learn, on dried grass and
the stems of plants in proximity to the growing plants upon
which the young caterpillars are destined to feed.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The head of the caterpillar when it emerges
from the egg is somewhat larger than the rest of the body, but
as it passes successive moults and attains maturity the relative
thickness of the body increases, and the adult larva tapers a
little from about the middle in either direction. The larv&aelig; are
pale green or brown, marked by darker stripes upon the back
and on the sides, the markings on the sides being in most species
more conspicuous than those on the back. The species all
feed on grasses.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalids are stout, very slightly angulated,
and are formed, so far as we know, unattached, under stones
and at the roots of grasses. When pupating, the caterpillar often
makes for itself a slight depression or cell in the soil, in which a
few threads of silk have been deposited, though not enough to
justify us in calling the structure a cocoon.</p>

<p>This genus is composed of butterflies which are mainly arctic
in their habitat, or dwell upon the summits of lofty mountains,
where the summer is but brief. Only a few species are found
at comparatively low elevations, and these in British America, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[ 220]</a></span>
the parts of the United States immediately contiguous to the
Canadian line. The most widely known of all the species up to
this time is the White Mountain Butterfly, <i>&OElig;neis semidea</i>, Say,
a colony of which has existed probably ever since the glacial
period upon the loftiest summit of Mount Washington, in New
Hampshire. A number of species are found in the region of the
Rocky Mountains. One species, <i>&OElig;neis jutta</i>, H&uuml;bner, occurs in
Maine, Nova Scotia, and parts adjacent. There are in all about
a score of species of this genus recognized by authors as occurring
in our fauna. In spite of the fact that these insects are
boreal or arctic in their habits, Mr. W.H. Edwards has with
marvelous skill and patience succeeded in obtaining the eggs
and rearing at his home in Coalburg, West Virginia, a number
of species. We are indebted to him for more of our knowledge
of the generic characteristics of these insects, in their early stages,
than had been ascertained hitherto during a century of investigation.
His work is one of the beautiful triumphs of that enduring
zeal which is a supreme quality in the naturalist. In their
early stages all of the species show a close likeness to one another.</p>

<p>(1) <b>&OElig;neis gigas</b>, Butler, Plate XXVII, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Fig. 2, &#9793;
(The Greater Arctic).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This, one of the largest species in the genus,
occurs on Vancouver's Island. The butterfly hides among the
dark mosses and upon the trunks of prostrate trees. The males
are vigilant and inquisitive, and dart out suddenly when alarmed,
or attracted by passing insects. The females have a slower and
more leisurely flight and are more readily taken. Expanse, 2.00-2.25
inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Edwards has figured the egg and the caterpillar
in its first three stages, but the remaining life-history of
the species awaits investigation.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This insect, which even exceeds <i>&OElig;. gigas</i> in size,
is found on the Coast Range in northern California. It is
decidedly lighter on the outer third of the wings than the preceding
species, the male being prevalently a pale yellowish-brown,
with the basal and median areas of the fore wing dark
brown. On the under side the wings are somewhat lighter than
in the preceding species, and the transverse lines are more distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[ 221]</a></span>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is closely allied to the two foregoing,
but may be distinguished by the broad median band of dark brown
traversing the under side of the hind wings, as well as by other
peculiarities of marking. It
lacks the bar of raised scales
which is found in the male sex
about the lower part of the cell
of the fore wing in most of the
species of the genus. It has

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is widely distributed, being found in
Colorado, British Columbia, and the vicinity of Hudson Bay. It
is distinguished from other species by the darker brown color,
which covers the basal and median areas of both the fore and
hind wings, leaving a broad band of lighter brown on the outer
margin. On the under side the wings are beautifully mottled
with white and dark brown. <i>&OElig;neis calais</i>, Scudder, is probably
only a form of <i>chryxus</i>, which is somewhat lighter in color
on the base of the wings. Expanse, 1.60-1.75 inch.</p>

by the peculiar pale ashen-brown of the upper side of the wings.
It is not a common species, and is apparently restricted to the
mountains of Nevada, principally about Lake Tahoe, though it
probably occurs elsewhere. Expanse, 1.90-2.10 inches.</p>

lands of Montana, North Dakota, and the parts of Canada adjacent.
It is not uncommon about Calgary. It is light in color on the upper

on the upper side than <i>varuna</i>, and the females are generally
very richly ornamented with eye-spots on the outer borders of
both the fore and hind wings. Expanse, 1.45-1.55 inch.</p>

in color than any of the species which have thus far been mentioned.
It is restricted in its habitat to the summit of Mount
Washington, in New Hampshire, and only reappears on the high
mountains of Colorado and in Labrador. Its life-history has
been very carefully worked out. It is to be hoped that entomologists
and tourists resorting to Mount Washington will not suffer
it to disappear by reason of too wholesale a capture of the
specimens, which hover about the barren rocks on which the
race has existed since the great continental ice-sheet melted away
and vanished from the face of New England. Expanse, 1.75

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Though somewhat closely related to the last species,
Bruce's Arctic may at once be distinguished from it by the
broad dark band on the under side of the secondaries and the
great translucency of the wings, which permits a label to be
read through them. It is found in Colorado and in British Columbia
at an elevation of from twelve to thirteen thousand feet
above sea-level. Expanse, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Much like <i>&OElig;. brucei</i>, but the wings are not so
translucent as in that species, and the broad mesial band on the
under side of the hind wings is differently shaped, being more
strongly directed outward just below the costa. The figure in
the plate is from a specimen taken at Nain, in Labrador. Expanse,
1.75 inch.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>IN THE FACE OF THE COLD</b></p>

<p>When the full moon hangs high overhead, the snow creaks
underfoot, the north wind roars with furious blast, and the
trees of the forests crack in the frost with a report like that of
cannon, then, hanging in its little nest on the bare branches of
the wind-tossed trees, the tiny caterpillar of the Viceroy keeps
the spark of life where men freeze and die. Nothing in the
realm of nature is more wonderful than the manner in which
some of the most minute animal forms resist cold. The genera
<i>Erebia</i> and <i>&OElig;neis</i>, and many species of the genus <i>Brenthis</i>, are,
as we have already learned, inhabitants of the arctic regions or
of lofty Alpine summits, the climate of which is arctic. Their
caterpillars often hibernate in a temperature of from forty to
fifty, and even seventy, degrees below zero, Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>It has been alleged that caterpillars freeze in the winter and
thaw out in the spring, at that time regaining their vitality.
Thus far the writer is unable to ascertain that any experiments
or observations have positively decided for or against this view.
A number of recorded cases in which caterpillars are positively
stated to have been frozen and to have afterward been found to
be full of vitality when thawed are open to question.</p>

<p>The most circumstantial account is that by Commander
James Ross, R.N., F.R.S., quoted by Curtis in the Entomological
Appendix to the "Narrative" of Sir John Ross's second
voyage to the arctic regions. The specimens upon which the
observations were made were the caterpillars of <i>Laria rossi</i>, a
moth which is found abundantly in the arctic regions of North
America. I quote from the account: "About thirty of the
caterpillars were put into a box in the middle of September, and
after being exposed to the severe winter temperature of the next
three months, they were brought into a warm cabin, where, in
less than two hours, every one of them returned to life, and
continued for a whole day walking about; they were again exposed
to the air at a temperature of about forty degrees below
zero, and became immediately hard-frozen; in this state they
remained a week, and on being brought again into the cabin,
only twenty-three came to life; these were, at the end of four
hours, put out once more into the air and again hard-frozen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[ 225]</a></span>
after another week they were again brought in, when only
eleven were restored to life; a fourth time they were exposed to
the winter temperature, and only two returned to life on being
again brought into the cabin; these two survived the winter,
and in May an imperfect <i>Laria</i> was produced from one, and six
flies from the other."</p>

<p>The foregoing account seems to verify more thoroughly the
stories that have been told than anything else I have been able to
discover within the limits of entomological literature, but does
not conclude argument. It would be interesting in these days,
when methods of artificial freezing have been so highly perfected,
to undertake a series of experiments to prove or disprove,
as the case may be, the view which has been held since the time
of the ancients. There is here a field for nice investigation on
the part of some reader of this book. In making the experiment
it probably would be well to select the larv&aelig; of species which
are known to hibernate during the winter and to be capable of
withstanding a great degree of cold.</p>

<p>The effect of cold suddenly applied to the chrysalids of
butterflies at the moment of pupation is often to produce remarkable
changes in the markings. The spots upon the wings
of butterflies emerging from chrysalids thus treated are frequently
rendered more or less indistinct and blurred. The dark markings
are intensified in color and enlarged; the pale markings
are also in some cases ascertained to experience enlargement.
Many of the strange and really beautiful aberrations known to
collectors have no doubt been produced by the action of frost
which has occurred at the season when the larva was pupating.
The species believed by the writer to be most prolific in aberrations
are species which pupate early in the spring from caterpillars
which have hibernated or which pupate late in the
autumn. Some are species found at considerable altitudes
above sea-level, where late frosts and early frosts are apt to
occur. A number of very beautiful experiments upon the effect
of cold upon the color of butterflies have been made in recent
years, and some very curious phenomena have been observed.
The writer has in his collection a considerable number of
strikingly aberrant specimens which emerged from chrysalids
treated to a sudden artificial lowering of the temperature at the
critical period of pupation.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The butterflies of this family are very readily distinguished
from all others by their long projecting palpi, and by
the fact that the males have four feet adapted to walking, while
the females have six, in which respect they approach the Erycinid&aelig;.</p>

<p>Only one genus is represented in our faunal region, the
genus <i>Libythea</i>.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 124.</a>&mdash;Neuration

<i>Libythea</i>.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Rather small in size, with the eyes moderately
large; the antenn&aelig; with a distinct club at the end; the palpi
with the last joint extremely long and heavily clothed with hair.
The wings have the outer margin strongly excised
between the first median nervule and the lower
radial vein. Between the upper and lower radial
veins the wing is strongly produced outwardly;
the inner margin is bowed out toward the base
before the inner angle. The costa of the hind wing
is bent upward at the base and excised before
the outer angle; the wing is produced at the
ends of the subcostal vein, the third median nervule,
and the extremity of the submedian vein.
There is also a slight projection at the extremity of the first median
nervule. Of these projections the one at the extremity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[ 227]</a></span>
the third median nervule is the most pronounced. The cell of
the primaries and of the secondaries is lightly closed.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is ovoid, nearly twice as high as wide, with narrow
vertical ridges on the sides, every other ridge much higher than
its mate and increasing in height toward the vertex, where they abruptly
terminate, their extremities ranging around the small depressed
micropyle. Between these ridges are minute cross-lines.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar has the head small, the anterior
segments greatly swollen and overarching the head. The remainder
of the body is cylindrical.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is of a somewhat singular shape,
the abdomen conical, the head sharply pointed, a raised ridge
running from the extremity of the head to the middle of the first
abdominal segment on either side, and between these ridges is
the slightly projecting thoracic tubercle. On the ventral side
the outline is nearly straight.</p>

<p>The caterpillar feeds upon <i>Celtis occidentalis</i>. Three species
are reckoned as belonging to our fauna. It is, however, doubtful
whether these species are in reality such, and there is reason to
believe that the three are merely varietal forms or races, no structural
difference being apparent in any of them, and the only differences
consisting in the ground-color of the wings.</p>

<h2>FAMILY II. LEMONIID&AElig;</h2>

<h3>SUBFAMILY ERYCININ&AElig; (THE METAL-MARKS)</h3>

</div></div>


<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Small, the males having four ambulatory feet,
the females six, in which respect they resemble the Libythein&aelig;,
from which they may readily be distinguished by the small palpi.
There is great variety in the shape and neuration of the wings.
The genera of this subfamily have the precostal vein on the extreme
inner margin of the wing; in some genera free at its end,
and projecting so as to form a short frenulum, as in many genera
of the moths. In addition the costal vein sends up a branch
at the point from which the precostal is usually emitted. This
apparent doubling of the precostal is found in no other group of
butterflies, and is a strong diacritical mark by which they may
be recognized. They are said to carry their
wings expanded when at rest, and frequently
alight on the under surface of leaves, in this
respect somewhat approaching in their habit
the pyralid moths. Many of the species are
most gorgeously colored; but those which are
found within our region are for the most part
not gaily marked. They may be distinguished
from the Lyc&aelig;nid&aelig; not only by the peculiar neuration
and manner of carrying the wings, but by
the relatively longer and more slender antenn&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Comparatively little is known of these, though
in certain respects the larv&aelig; and the chrysalis show a relationship
to the Lyc&aelig;nid&aelig;, with which some writers have in fact grouped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[ 229]</a></span>
them, but erroneously, as the writer believes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XXVIII">Plate XXVIII</a>.</span></div>

<p>Almost all of the species are American, and the family attains
its highest development in the tropical regions of South America.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus LEMONIAS, Westwood</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Small, brightly colored, the sexes often differing
greatly in appearance from each other. The eyes are naked.
The palpi are produced, porrect; the last joint is short, thin,
pointed, and depressed. The antenn&aelig; are moderately
long, provided with a gradually thickening, inconspicuous
club. The upper discocellular vein is
wanting in the fore wing. The middle and lower
discocellulars are of equal length. The hind wing
has the end of the cell obliquely terminated by the
middle and lower discocellular veins. The apex of
the fore wing is somewhat pointed, the outward margin
straight. The outward margin of the hind wing is
evenly rounded.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Flattened, turban-shaped, with a small, depressed, circular
micropyle, the whole surface covered with minute hexagonal
reticulations.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;Short, flattened, tapering posteriorly; the segments
arched; provided with tufts of hair ranged in longitudinal
series, the hairs on the sides and at the anal extremity being long,
bent outward and downward.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;Short, suspended at the anal extremity, and held
in position by a silk girdle, but not closely appressed to the
surface upon which pupation has taken place; thickly covered
with short, projecting hair.</p>

<p>The citadel of this genus is found about the head waters of
the Amazon, where there are many species. Thence the genus
spreads northward and southward, being represented in the
limits of our fauna by only a few species, which are found on the
extreme southern borders of the United States.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Lemonias mormo</b>, Felder, Plate XXVIII, Fig. 7, &#9794;, <i>under
side</i> (The Mormon).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings on the upper side are dark ashen-gray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[ 230]</a></span>
with the primaries from the base to the limbal area, and inwardly
as far as the bottom of the cell and the first median nervule, red.
The wings are profusely marked with white spots variously
disposed. The under side is accurately depicted in our plate.
Expanse, 1.10 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have not been studied.</p>

<p>The Mormon is found in Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and
California.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Lemonias duryi</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVIII, Fig. 10, &#9793;
(Dury's Metal-mark).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The only specimen as yet known is the type
figured in our plate. I doubt whether it is entitled to specific
rank, and am inclined to believe it to be a form of the succeeding
species in which red has replaced the greater part of the gray on
the upper side of both wings. Expanse, 1.25 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The specimen came from New Mexico.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Lemonias cythera</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVIII, Fig. 4, &#9793;,
<i>under side</i>; Fig. 5, &#9794; (Cythera).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Distinguished from <i>L. mormo</i> by the red submarginal
band on the secondaries on the upper side, the greater
prevalence of red on the primaries, and by the tendency of the
spots on the under side of the secondaries, just after the costa,
to fuse and form an elongate pearly-white ray. The submarginal
spots on the lower side of the fore wings are smaller
than in <i>mormo</i>. The sexes do not differ except in size. Expanse,
1.00-1.30 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p><i>Cythera</i> is found in Arizona and Mexico.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Lemonias virgulti</b>, Behr, Plate XXVIII, Fig. 6, &#9794; (Behr's
Metal-mark).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Much like the preceding species on the upper side
of the wings, but darker. The hind wings on the under side are
much darker than in <i>L. cythera</i>, and the pearly-white spots
relatively smaller, standing out very distinctly on this darker
ground. Expanse, .90-1.10 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Undescribed.</p>

<p><i>Virgulti</i> is common in southern California and Mexico.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Lemonias nais</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVIII, Fig. 8, &#9794;; Fig.
9, &#9793; (Nais).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[ 231]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The ground-color of the upper side is bright red,
clouded with fuscous on the base of the hind wings and bordered
with the same color. There is a small precostal white
spot on the primaries near the apex. The wings are profusely
marked with small black spots arranged in transverse series and
bands. The fringes are checkered with white. On the under
side the wings are pale reddish, mottled with buff on the secondaries.
The black spots and markings of the upper side reappear
on the under side and stand out boldly on the lighter ground-color.
Expanse, 1.00-1.25 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are beautifully delineated in "The Butterflies
of North America," vol. ii. The egg is pale green, turban-shaped,
covered with hexagonal reticulations. The caterpillar is
rather stout and short, the first segment projecting over the head.
The body is somewhat flattened and tapering behind, covered with
tufts of hairs projecting outward and downward on all sides,
only the two rows of short tufts on the back sending their hairs
upward. The color is mouse-gray, striped longitudinally on the
back with yellowish-white, the tufts more or less ringed about at
their base with circles of the same color. The chrysalis is blackish-brown,
attached at the anal end, held in place by a girdle, but
not closely appressed to the surface on which pupation has taken
place, and thickly studded with small projecting hairs. The larva
lives on the wild plum.</p>

<p><i>Nais</i> occurs from Colorado to Mexico east of the Rocky
Mountains.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Lemonias palmeri</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVIII, Fig. 11, &#9794;
(Palmer's Metal-mark).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Smaller than any of the preceding species. The
ground-color of the wings is mouse-gray, spotted with white; on
the under side the wings are whitish-gray, laved with pale red
at the base of the fore wings. The white spots of the upper side
reappear on the under side. Expanse, .75-.95 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are, so far as they have been worked
out by Edwards, quite similar in many respects to those of the
preceding species.</p>

<p>The range of the species is from Utah southward to Mexico.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Lemonias zela</b>, Butler, Plate XXVIII, Fig. 17, &#9794;; Fig. 18,
&#9793; (Zela).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side of both sexes is delineated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[ 232]</a></span>
plate. On the under side the wings are pale red, marked with a
few black spots, representing on the under side the markings
of the upper side. Of these, the spots of the median and submarginal
bands are most conspicuous. Expanse, 1.00-1.35
inch.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Lemonias zela</b>, Butler, var. <b>cleis</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVIII,
Fig. 19, &#9794;; Fig. 20, &#9793; (Cleis).</p>

<p>The pale variety, <i>cleis</i>, is sufficiently well represented in our
plate to need no description. On the under side it is like <i>L.
zela</i>.</p>

<p>The species occurs in Arizona and Mexico.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus CALEPHELIS, Grote and Robinson</b></p>

upper side, brighter red on the under side. On
both the upper and under sides the wings are
profusely spotted with small steely-blue metallic markings, arranged
in more or less regular transverse series, especially on the

Fig. 12, &#9794;, <i>under side</i>; Fig. 13, &#9794; (The Northern Metal-mark).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Fully twice as large as the preceding species. The
wings on the upper side are sooty-brown, spotted with black,
and marked by a marginal and submarginal series of small metallic
spots. On the under side the wings are light red, spotted
with a multitude of small black spots arranged in regular series.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[ 233]</a></span>
The two rows of metallic spots near the margins are repeated
more distinctly on this side. Expanse, 1.15 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This rare insect has been taken from New York to Virginia,
and as far west as Michigan and Illinois. The only specimen I
have ever seen in life I took at the White Sulphur Springs in West
Virginia. It settled on the under side of a twig of black birch,
with expanded wings, just over my head, and by a lucky stroke
of the net I swept it in.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Calephelis australis</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVIII, Fig. 14, &#9794;
(The Southern Metal-mark).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings in the male sex are more pointed at
the apex than in the preceding species, and in both sexes are
smaller in expanse. The color of the upper side of the wings is
dusky, on the under side pale yellowish-red. On both sides the
wings are obscurely marked with dark spots arranged in transverse
series. The marginal and submarginal metallic bands of
spots are as in the preceding species. Expanse, 1.00 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p><i>Australis</i> ranges from Texas and Arizona into Mexico.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Calephelis nemesis</b>, Edwards, Plate XXVIII, Fig. 15, &#9794;
(The Dusky Metal-mark).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Very small,&mdash;as small as <i>c&oelig;nius</i>,&mdash;but with the
fore wings at the apex decidedly pointed in the male sex. The
wings are dusky-brown above, lighter obscure reddish below.
Both the primaries and the secondaries on the upper side are
crossed by a dark median band, broader on the primaries at the
costa. The metallic markings are quite small and indistinct.
Expanse, .85 inch.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>MIMICRY</b></p>

<p>Protective mimicry as it occurs in animals may be the simulation
in form or color, or both, of natural objects, or it may be the
simulation of the form and color of another animal, which for
some reason enjoys immunity from the attacks of species which
ordinarily prey upon its kind. Of course this mimicry is unconscious
and is the result of a slow process of development which
has, no doubt, gone on for ages.</p>

<p>Remarkable instances of mimicry, in which things are simulated,
are found in the insect world. The "walking-sticks," as
they are called, creatures which resemble the twigs of trees;
the "leaf-insects," in which the foliage of plants is apparently
reproduced in animate forms; the "leaf-butterfly" of India, in
which the form and the color and even the venation of leaves are
reproduced, are illustrations of mimicry which are familiar to all
who have given any attention to the subject.</p>

<p>Repulsive objects are frequently mimicked. A spider has
been lately described from the Indo-Malayan region, which, as it
rests upon the leaves, exactly resembles a patch of bird-lime.
The resemblance is so exact as to deceive the most sagacious,
and the discovery of the creature was due to the fact that the
naturalist who happened to see it observed, to his surprise, that
what he was positive was a mass of ordure was actually in
motion. A similar case of mimicry is observable among some of
the small acontiid moths of North America. One of these is pure
white, with the tips of the fore wings dark greenish-brown. It
sits on the upper side of leaves, with its fore wings folded over,
or rolled about the hind wings, and in this attitude it so nearly
approximates in appearance the ordure of a sparrow as to have
often deceived me when collecting.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Small, in both sexes having all feet adapted to
walking. There is exceeding diversity of form in the various genera
composing this family. Many of the genera are characterized
by the brilliant blue on the upper side of the wings; in other
genera shades of coppery-red predominate. The hair-streaks
frequently have the hind wings adorned with one or more slender,
elongated tails. In Africa and in Asia there are numerous
genera which strongly mimic protected insects belonging to the
Acr&aelig;in&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs are for the most part flattened or turban-shaped,
curiously and beautifully adorned with ridges, minute
eminences, and reticulations. Some of them under the microscope
strongly resemble the shells of "sea-biscuits" with the
rays removed (see p. 4, Fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillars are for the most part slug-shaped,
flattened. They are vegetable feeders, save the larv&aelig; of
two or three genera, which are aphidivorous, feeding upon mealy
bugs or plant-lice.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalids are short, compressed, attached at
the anal extremity, with a girdle or cincture about the middle,
closely fastened to the surface upon which pupation takes place.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Genus EUM&AElig;US, H&uuml;bner</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[ 237]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Medium size or small; dark in color, with the
under side and the borders of the upper sides beautifully adorned
with spots having a metallic luster. The palpi are divergent,
longer in the female than in the male. The antenn&aelig;
are stout, rather short, with a gradually
thickened club. The eyes are naked. The veins
on the fore wing are stout. The accompanying
cut gives a clear idea of the neuration.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Nothing is known of these.</p>

<p>Three species are reckoned as belonging to
the genus, two of them being found sparingly
in the extreme southern limits of our fauna.</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Small or medium-sized; on the upper side often
colored brilliantly with iridescent blue or green, sometimes dark
brown or reddish; on the under side marked with lines and
spots variously disposed, sometimes obscure in color, very frequently
most brilliantly colored.</p>

<p>Various subdivisions based upon the neuration of the wings
have been made in the genus in recent years, and these subdivisions
are entitled to be accepted by those who are engaged in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[ 238]</a></span>
comparative study of the species belonging to this great group.
Inasmuch, however, as most American writers have heretofore
classified all of these insects under the genus
<i>Thecla</i>, the author has decided not to deviate
from familiar usage, and will therefore not
attempt to effect a subdivision according to the
views of recent writers, which he nevertheless
approves as scientifically accurate.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Considerable diversity exists in the form
of the eggs of the various species included under
this genus as treated in this book, but all of them
may be said to be turban-shaped, more or less
depressed at the upper extremity, with their surfaces
beautifully adorned with minute projections
arranged in geometric patterns.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillars are slug-shaped,
their heads minute, the body abruptly tapering at
the anal extremity. They feed upon the tender leaves of the
ends of branches, some of them upon the leaves of flowers of
various species.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;What has been said concerning the chrysalids of
the family applies likewise to the chrysalids of this and the succeeding
genera. They lie closely appressed to the surface upon
which they are formed, and are held in place by an attachment
at the anal extremity, as well as by a slight girdle of silk about
the middle. In color they are generally some shade of brown.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Thecla grunus</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXIX, Fig. 12, &#9794; (Boisduval's
Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings are brown on the upper side, lighter
on the disk; in some specimens, more frequently of the female
sex, bright orange-tawny. On the under side the wings are pale
tawny, with transverse marginal and submarginal series of small
dark spots on both wings. Two or three of the marginal spots
near the anal angle are black, each crowned with a metallic-green
crescent. Expanse, 1.10-1.20 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have, in part, been described by Dyar,
"Canadian Entomologist," vol. xxv, p. 94. The caterpillar is
short, flattened, the segments arched, the body tapering backward,
bluish-green, covered with little dark warty prominences
bearing tufts of hairs, obscurely striped longitudinally with broken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[ 239]</a></span>
pale lines, and having a diamond-shaped shield back of the
head. The chrysalis is thick and conformed to the generic type
of structure. The color is pale green, striped and dotted with
pale yellow on the abdomen. The caterpillar feeds in the Yosemite
Valley upon the young leaves of the live-oak (<i>Quercus chrysolepis</i>).</p>

<p>The insect is found in California and Nevada.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Thecla crysalus</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIX, Fig. 11, &#9794; (The
Colorado Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings on the upper side are royal purple,
broadly margined with black. On the fore wings a broad
oblique black band runs from the middle of the costa to the middle
of the outer margin. At the inner angles of both wings are
conspicuous orange spots. On the under side the wings are
fawn, marked with white lines edged with brown. The orange
spots reappear on this side, but at the anal angle of the hind
wings are transformed to red eye-spots, pupiled with black and
margined with metallic green. The hind wings are tailed. Expanse,
1.50 inch.</p>

<p>The variety <b>citima</b>, Henry Edwards, differs in being without
the orange spots and having the ground-color of the under side
ashen-gray. Specimens connecting the typical with the varietal
form are in my possession.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>Found in southern Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and southern
California.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Thecla halesus</b>, Cramer, Plate XXIX, Fig. 9, &#9794; (The
Great Purple Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The hind wings have a long tail, and are lobed at
the anal angle. The wings are fuscous, iridescent bluish-green
at the base. The body is bluish-green above. On the under side
the thorax is black, spotted with white, the abdomen bright orange-red.
The wings on the under side are evenly warm sepia, spotted
with crimson at their bases, glossed with a ray of metallic green
on the fore wings in the male sex, and in both sexes splendidly
adorned at the anal angle by series of metallic-green and iridescent
blue and red spots. Expanse, 1.35-1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;All we know of them is derived from the drawings
of Abbot, published by Boisduval and Leconte, and this is
but little. The caterpillar is said by Abbot to feed on various oaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[ 240]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very common in Central America and Mexico; is not
scarce in the hot parts of the Gulf States; and is even reported as
having been captured in southern Illinois. It also occurs in Arizona
and southern California.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Thecla m-album</b>, Boisduval and Leconte, Plate XXIX,
Fig. 10, &#9794; (The White-M Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Smaller than the preceding species; on the upper
side somewhat like it; but the iridescent color at the base of the
wings is blue, and not so green as in <i>halesus</i>. On the under
side the wings are quite differently marked. The fore wing is
crossed by a submarginal and a median line of white, shaded
with brown, the median line most distinct. This line is continued
upon the hind wings, and near the anal angle is zigzagged, so as
to present the appearance of an inverted M. Near the outer angle
of the M-spot is a rounded crimson patch. The anal angle is deep
black, glossed with iridescent blue. Expanse, 1.35-1.45 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;All we know of this pretty species is based
upon the account and drawings of Abbot made in the last century.
We need better information. According to Abbot, the caterpillar
feeds on <i>astragalus</i> and different oaks.</p>

<p>This species has been taken as far north as Jersey City and
Wisconsin, and ranges southward as far as Venezuela. Its citadel
is found in the live-oak hummocks of the Gulf States and the
oak forests on the highlands of Mexico and more southern
countries.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Thecla martialis</b>, Herrich-Sch&auml;ffer, Plate XXX, Fig. 18,
&#9793;, <i>under side</i> (The Martial Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The insect figured in the plate, which may easily
be recognized by its under side, has been determined by Dr.
Skinner to be the above species. My specimens coming from
the Edwards collection are labeled <i>Thecla acis</i>, &#9793;. They were
taken at Key West. A comparison with the under side of <i>T.
acis</i> (see Plate XXIX, Fig. 38) will reveal the great difference.

<p>(6) <b>Thecla favonius</b>, Abbot and Smith, Plate XXIX, Fig. 22,
&#9794; (The Southern Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings are dusky-brown above, with a small
pale oval sex-mark in the male near the upper edge of the cell in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[ 241]</a></span>
the primaries. On either side of the second median nervule, near
the outer margin of both wings, are bright orange-red patches,
most conspicuous in the female. The hind wings near the anal
angle are blackish, margined with a fine white line. On the
under side the wings are marked much as in <i>m-album</i>, but in the
region of the median nervules, midway between their origin and
termination, is a rather broad transverse carmine streak, edged inwardly
with dark lines. This is largest and most conspicuous in
the female sex. Expanse, 1.00-1.15 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described, in part, by Abbot
and Smith and Packard. The caterpillar feeds on oaks.</p>

<p><i>Favonius</i> is found in the Gulf States, and as far north as
South Carolina.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Thecla wittfeldi</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIX, Fig. 19, &#9793;;
Fig. 20, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (Wittfeld's Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The figures in the plate give a correct idea of both
the upper and under sides of this insect. It is much darker in
ground-color than any of its congeners. Expanse, 1.25-1.35 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The types which are in my possession came from the Indian
River district in Florida.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Thecla autolycus</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIX, Fig. 13, &#9793;
(The Texas Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;On the upper side resembling <i>favonius</i>, but
with the orange-red spots on the wings much broader, ranging
from the lower radial vein to the submedian in the fore wings.
The carmine spots on the under side of the wings are not arranged
across the median nervules, as in <i>favonius</i>, but are in the
vicinity of the anal angle, crowning the black crescents near the
inner end of the outer margin. Expanse, 1.15-1.30 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This species is found in Texas, and is also said to have been
found in Missouri and Kansas.</p>

<p>(9) <b>Thecla alcestis</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIX, Fig. 14, &#9793; (Alcestis).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Uniformly slaty-gray on the upper side of the
wings, with the usual oval sex-mark on the fore wing of the
male, and a few bluish scales near the anal angle. The ground-color
of the wings on the under side is as above, but somewhat
paler. A white bar closes the cell of both wings. Both wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[ 242]</a></span>
are crossed by white lines, much as in <i>m-album</i>. The anal angle
is marked with black, followed outwardly by a broad patch of
iridescent greenish-blue scales. Between the end of the submarginal
vein and the first median nervule is a black spot surmounted
with carmine, edged inwardly with black; three or four
carmine crescents similarly edged, but rapidly diminishing in size,
extend as a transverse submarginal band toward the costa. Expanse,
1.25 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p><i>Alcestis</i> is found in Texas and Arizona.</p>

<p>(10) <b>Thecla melinus</b>, H&uuml;bner, Plate XXIX, Fig. 31, &#9794;;

</div>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Much confusion has arisen from the fact that this
insect has received a number of names and has also been confounded
with others. Fig. 31 in Plate XXIX represents
the insect labeled <i>humuli</i>, Harris, in the Edwards
collection; Fig. 20 in Plate XXXII represents
the insect labeled <i>melinus</i>, H&uuml;bner. There is a very
large series of both in the collection, but a minute
comparison fails to reveal any specific difference.
<i>Humuli</i> of Harris is the same as <i>melinus</i> of H&uuml;bner;
and recent authors, I think, are right in sinking the
name given by Harris as a synonym. This common
little butterfly may easily be recognized by its plain
slaty upper surface, adorned by a large black spot,
crowned with crimson between the origin of the two
tails of the secondaries. Expanse, 1.10-1.20 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are in part well known. The
caterpillar feeds on the hop-vine. <i>Melinus</i> is found all over temperate
North America, and ranges southward into Mexico and
Central America at suitable elevations.</p>

<p>(11) <b>Thecla acadica</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIX, Fig. 15, &#9794;;
Plate V, Fig. 35, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Acadian Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male is pale slaty-gray above, with some ill-defined
orange spots near the anal angle, the usual oval sex-mark
on the fore wing. The female is like the male above; but
the orange spots at the anal angle of the hind wings are broader,
and in some specimens similar spots appear on the fore wings
near the inner angle. On the under side in both sexes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[ 243]</a></span>
wings are pale wood-brown, adorned by a black bar at the end
of the cells, submarginal and median bands of small black spots
surrounded with white, and on the secondaries by a submarginal
series of red crescents diminishing in size from the anal angle toward
the outer angle. Near the anal angle are two black spots separated
by a broad patch of bluish-green scales. Expanse, 1.15-1.25 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;For a knowledge of what is known of these
the reader may consult the pages of Scudder and Edwards. The
caterpillar feeds upon willows.</p>

<p>It is found all over the Northern States, ranging from Quebec
to Vancouver's Island. It seems to be very common on Mount
Hood, from which I have a large series of specimens.</p>

<p>(12) <b>Thecla itys</b>, Edwards, Plate XXIX, Fig. 17, &#9793; (Itys).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Dark plumbeous-brown on the upper side, with a
pale sex-mark on the fore wing of the male. On the under side
the wings are paler and a trifle warmer brown, with their outer
halves marked with numerous fine white broken lines arranged
in pairs, with the space between them darker than the ground-color
of the wing. The usual black spots, green scales, and
red crescents are found near the anal angle on the under side.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;For all that is known of these the reader will
do well to consult the pages of Scudder. The caterpillar feeds
on oaks.</p>

<p>The species ranges from Quebec westward to Colorado and
Nebraska, being found commonly in New England.</p>

<p>(14) <b>Thecla calanus</b>, H&uuml;bner, Plate XXIX, Fig. 26, &#9793;; Plate
V, Figs. 25, 27, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Banded Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;On the upper side resembling the preceding species
very closely, but a trifle darker, and warmer brown. On
the under side the wings are marked by fine white lines on the
outer half, which are not broken, as in <i>edwardsi</i>, but form continuous
bands. Expanse, 1.15 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar feeds on oaks. The life-history
is described with minute exactness by Scudder in "The Butterflies

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Dark brown on the upper side, grayish below.
The lines are arranged much as in <i>T. edwardsi</i>, but are farther
apart, often very narrow, scarcely defining the dark bands
between them. The spots at the anal angle are obscure and
blackish. Expanse, 1.15 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Much like those of the allied species. Scudder,
in "The Butterflies of New England," gives a full account of
them. The caterpillar feeds on a variety of plants&mdash;oaks, willows,
the wild plum, and other rosaceous plants, as well as on
the <i>Ericace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>It ranges through the northern Atlantic States and Quebec to

Fig. 34, &#9793; (The Hedge-row Hair-streak).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Almost identically like the preceding species, except
that the wings on the upper side are a trifle redder, on the

narrowly defined externally by white, and the anal spots are
better developed and defined on the hind wings. Expanse, 1.20
inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This species is found throughout the Pacific States, and I am
inclined to believe it identical with <i>chalcis</i>. If this should be

<p class="cen"><b>THE UTILITY OF ENTOMOLOGY</b></p>

<p>All the forces of nature are interdependent. Many plants
would not bear seeds or fruit were it not for the activity of insects,
which cause the pollen to be deposited upon the pistil and the
seed-vessel to be fertilized. Attempts were made many years
ago to grow clover in Australia, but the clover did not make
seed. All the seed required for planting had to be imported at
much expense from Europe. It was finally ascertained that the
reason why the clover failed to make seed was because throughout
Australia there were no bumblebees. Bumblebees were introduced,
and now clover grows luxuriantly in Australia, making
seed abundantly; and Australian meats, carried in the cold-storage
rooms of great ocean steamers, are used to feed the people of
Manila, Hong-Kong, Yokohama, and even London.</p>

<p>A few years ago the orange-groves in southern California became
infested with a scale-insect, which threatened to ruin them
and to bring orange-growing in that part of the land to an unprofitable
end. The matter received the careful attention of the
chief entomologist of the United States Department of Agriculture,
the lamented Professor C.V. Riley. In the course of the
studies which he and his associates prosecuted, it was ascertained
that the same scale-insect which was ruining the orange-groves
of California is found in the orange-groves of Queensland, but
that in Queensland this insect did comparatively small injury to
the trees. Investigation disclosed the fact that in Queensland the
scale-insect was kept down by the ravages of a parasitic insect
which preyed upon it. This parasite, by order of the chief entomologist,
was immediately imported, in considerable numbers,
into southern California, and let loose among the orange-groves.
The result has been most beneficial.</p>

<p>These are two illustrations, from among hundreds which
might be cited, of the very practical value of entomological
knowledge.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XXXI">Plate XXXI</a>.</span></div>
<p>The annual loss suffered by agricultural communities through
ignorance of entomological facts is very great. Every plant has
its insect enemy, or, more correctly, its insect lover, which feeds
upon it, delights in its luxuriance, but makes short work, it may
be of leaves, it may be of flowers, it may be of fruit. It has
been estimated that every known species of plant has five or six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[ 257]</a></span>
species of insects which habitually feed upon it. Where the
plant is one that is valuable to man and is grown for his use,
the horticulturist or the farmer finds himself confronted, presently,
by the ravages of these creatures, and unless he has correct
information as to the best manner in which to combat them,
he is likely to suffer losses of a serious character. We all have
read of the havoc wrought by the Kansas locust, or grasshopper,
and of the ruin brought about by insects of the same class in
Asia and in Africa. We all have heard of the Hessian fly, of
the weevil, and of the army-worm. The legislature of Massachusetts
has in recent years been spending hundreds of thousands
of dollars in the attempt to exterminate the gipsy-moth.
The caterpillar of the cabbage-butterfly ruins every year material
enough to supply sauer-kraut to half of the people. The codling-moth,
the little pinkish caterpillar of which worms its way
through apples, is estimated to destroy five millions of dollars'
worth of apples every year within the limits of the United
States. And what shall we say of the potato-bug, that prettily
striped beetle, which, starting from the far West, has taken possession
of the potato-fields of the continent, and for the extermination
of which there is annually spent, by the agricultural
communities of the United States, several millions of dollars in
labor and in poisons?</p>

<p>A few facts like these serve to show that the study of entomology
is not a study which deserves to be placed in the category
of useless pursuits. Viewed merely from a utilitarian
standpoint, this study is one of the most important, far outranking,
in its actual value to communities, the study of many
branches of zo&ouml;logical science which some people affect to regard
as of a higher order.</p>

<p>The legislature of Pennsylvania acted wisely in passing a law
which demands that in every high school established within the
State there shall be at least one teacher capable of giving instruction
in botany and in entomology. The importance of entomology,
while not perceived by the masses as yet, has been recognized
by almost all the legislatures of the States; and not only
the general government of the United States, but the governments
of the individual commonwealths, are at the present time employing
a number of carefully trained men, whose business is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[ 258]</a></span>
ascertain the facts and instruct the people as to the best manner
in which to ward off the attacks of the insect swarms, which are
respecters neither of size nor beauty in the vegetable world, attacking
alike the majestic oak and the lowliest mosses.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Generally small, for the most part blue on the
upper side of the wings, white or gray on the under side, variously
marked with spots and lines.</p>

<p>What has been said in reference to the subdivision of the
genus <i>Thecla</i> may be repeated in regard to the genus which we
are considering. It has been in recent years subdivided by
writers who have given close attention to the matter, and these
subdivisions are entirely defensible from a scientific standpoint.
Nevertheless, owing to the close resemblance which prevails
throughout the group, in this book, which is intended for popular
use, the author has deemed it best not to separate the species,
as to do so presupposes a minute anatomical knowledge, which
the general reader is not likely to possess.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Lyc&aelig;na lycea</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXII, Fig. 18, &#9794;, <i>under
side</i> (Lycea).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The perfect insect is very nearly as large as <i>L. heteronea</i>.
The male is lilac-blue on the upper side, with the margins
dusky. The black spots of the under side do not show
through on the upper side, as in <i>L. heteronea</i>. The female is
dusky, with the wings shot with blue at their bases, more especially
on the fore wing. There are no black spots on the

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The insect on the upper side closely resembles the
preceding species in both sexes. On the under side it may be
at once distinguished from the following species by the absence
on the margin of the hind wings of the fine black terminal line,
and by having only one, not two rows of submarginal black
spots. There are other marked and striking differences, and the
merging of <i>L. d&aelig;dalus</i>, Behr, with this species, which has been
advocated by some recent writers, is no doubt due to their lack
of sufficient and accurately identified material. Expanse, 1.35 inch.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings of the male on the upper side are deep
lustrous blue, with darker borders and white fringes. The
wings of the female are brown, margined with reddish. The
name &oelig;chaja was applied to this sex by Dr. Behr, before it was
known to be the female of his <i>L. d&oelig;dalus</i>. Expanse, 1.12 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have not yet been studied.</p>

borders. The female is dusky, with a little blue at the base of
the wings on the same side. Below, the spots on the fore wings
are strongly defined; on the hind wings they are white on a pale
stone-gray ground. Expanse, 1.20 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;We know no more of these than we do of
those of the preceding species.</p>

<p><i>Pheres</i> has nearly the same range as <i>s&oelig;piolus.</i></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;On the upper side the male is pale lilac-blue, the
female dusky, heavily marked with blue at the base of the wings.
On the under side the wings are deep, warm stone-gray. There
is a single quite regular band of large-sized black spots on the
fore wing beyond the middle, and a triply festooned curved band
of similar spots on the hind wing. These spots are all margined
with white. Expanse, 1.15-1.25 inch.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The wings in both sexes are variable pale blue,
dusky on the margins, with white fringes checkered with dusky
at the ends of the veins. On the under side the wings are dark
gray, profusely spotted, the most characteristic markings being
a white ray in the cell of the hind wings, a broad submarginal
band of white arrow-shaped markings on both wings, with a
black spot at the tip of each sagittate maculation and a dark
triangular shade between the barbs. These markings are not
shown as they should be in Plate XXX, Fig. 44. They are only
faintly indicated. Expanse, 1.25-1.30 inch.</p>

the wings are smoky-gray, with all the black spots, which are
arranged as in the preceding species, greatly enlarged and quadrate,
and a broad submarginal border of orange on the hind
wings. The female is like the male, but with more orange on
the upper side of the hind wings.</p>

Fig. 24, &#9793; (The Shasta Blue).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The figures in the plate give a fairly good idea of
the upper side of this species in both sexes, though the male is
not quite so dark a blue as represented. On the under side the
wings have the usual black spots, on a dirty-gray ground, and,
in addition, on the hind wings there are a number of small marginal
spots surmounted by metallic-colored bluish-green scales,
somewhat like those found in some species of the genus <i>Thecla</i>.
Expanse, 1.00 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;So far as I know, these have never been described.</p>

<p>My specimens are all from Montana and Nevada. It is also

Fig. 26, &#9793; (The Orange-margined Blue).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side is pale blue, with a
narrow black marginal line and white fringes. The female is
brown or lilac-gray, with a series of orange-red crescents on the
margins of both wings. On the under side the wings are stone-gray,
with the usual spots, and on the secondaries the orange-colored
marginal spots are oblong, tipped inwardly with black
and outwardly by a series of metallic-green maculations.
Expanse, .90-1.15 inch.</p>

three species belong. On the upper side the male cannot be dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[ 266]</a></span>tinguished
from <i>L. melissa</i>; the female is darker and has only a
few orange crescents on the outer margin of the hind wing. On
the under side the wings are shining white, the spots are much
reduced in size, the large orange spots found in <i>L. melissa</i>
are replaced by quite small yellowish or ochreous spots, and the
patches of metallic scales defining them externally are very
minute. Expanse, 1.00-1.10 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are accurately described by Dr. Scudder
in his great work, "The Butterflies of New England," and by
others. The caterpillar feeds upon the lupine, and probably
other leguminous plants.</p>

<p>It is widely distributed through the basin of the St. Lawrence,
the region of the Great Lakes, and northward as far as British
Columbia, being also found on the Catskill Mountains. I have

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The plate gives a good representation of the male
and the female of this pretty species, which may at a glance be
distinguished from all its allies by the broad orange-red band on
the hind wings, marked by small black spots. On the under side
it is marked much as <i>L. melissa</i>. Expanse, .90-1.10 inch.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;On the under side this species is very like <i>enoptes</i>
and other allied species. The male looks like a dwarfed specimen
of <i>L. scudderi</i>. The female is dull bluish-gray above, with
black spots on the outer margins of the wing, most distinct on
the secondaries, and, instead of a band of orange spots before
them, a diffuse band of blue spots, paler than the surrounding
parts of the wing. Expanse, .95-1.00 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These furnish a field for investigation.</p>

<p>The insect is reported thus far only from Newfoundland,
from which locality I obtained, through the purchase of the

Plate V, Figs. 36, 43, 44, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Common Blue).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This common but most interesting insect has been
made the subject of most exhaustive and elaborate study by Mr.
W.H. Edwards, and the result has been to show that it is highly
subject to variation. It illustrates the phenomena of polymorphism
most beautifully. The foregoing references to the plate
cite the figures of the typical summer form. In addition to this
form the following forms have received names:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Winter form <b>lucia</b>, Kirby, Plate XXXI, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Plate
XXX, Fig. 20, &#9794;, <i>under side</i>. This appears in New England
in the early spring from overwintering chrysalids, and is characterized
by the brown patch on the middle of the hind wing on
the under side.</p>

&#9794;; Fig. 3, &#9793;; Plate XXX, Fig. 19, &#9794;, <i>under side</i>. This appears
at the same time as the preceding form. The
specimens figured in the plate were taken in Manitoba.
This form is characterized by the dark
margins of the wings on the under side.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Winter form <b>violacea</b>, Edwards, Plate
XXXI, Fig. 5, &#9794;. This is the common winter
form. The spots below are distinct, but never
fused or melted together, as in the two preceding
forms.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Form <b>nigra</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXI, Fig. 4,
&#9794;. The wings on the under side are as in <i>violacea</i>,
but are black above. It is found in West Virginia
and occurs also in Colorado.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Summer form <b>neglecta</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXI, Fig. 8, &#9794;;
Fig. 9, &#9793;. This is smaller than the typical form <i>pseudargiolus</i>,
also has the dark spots on the under side of the wings more distinct,
and the hind wings, especially in the female, paler.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>SIZE</b></p>

<p>Size, like wealth, is only relative. The farmer who owns a
hundred acres appears rich to the laborer whom he employs to
cut his wheat; but many a millionaire spends in one month as
much as would purchase two such farms. The earth seems great
to us, and the sun still greater; but doubtless there are suns the
diameter of which is equal to the distance from the earth to the sun,
in which both earth and sun would be swallowed up as mere drops
in an ocean of fire. In the animal kingdom there are vast disparities
in size, and these disparities are revealed in the lower as well
as in the higher classes. In the class of mammals we find tiny mice
and great elephants; in the insect world we find beetles which are
microscopic in size, and, not distantly related to them, beetles as
large as a clenched fist. The disparity between a field-mouse
and a sulphur-bottomed whale is no greater than the disparity in
size which exists between the smallest and the largest of the
beetle tribe. And so it is with the lepidoptera. It would take
several thousands of the Pygmy Blue, <i>Lyc&aelig;na exilis</i>, to equal in
weight one of the great bird-wing butterflies of the Australian
tropics. The greatest disparity in size in the order of the lepidoptera
is not, however, shown in the butterflies, but among the moths.
There are moths the wings of which do not cover more than
three sixteenths of an inch in expanse, and there are moths with
great bulky bodies and wings spreading from eight to nine inches.
It would require ten thousand of the former to equal in weight
one of the latter, and the disproportion in size is as great as that
which exists between a shrew and a hippopotamus, or between
a minnow and a basking-shark.</p>

<p>It is said that, taking the sulphur-bottomed whale as the
representative of the most colossal development of flesh and
blood now existing on land or in the sea, and then with the
microscope reaching down into the realm of protozoan life, the
common blow-fly will be ascertained to occupy the middle point
on the descending scale. Man is, therefore, not only mentally,
but even physically, a great creature, though he stands sometimes
amazed at what he regards as the huge proportions of other
creatures belonging to the vertebrates.</p>

<h2>FAMILY IV</h2>

<h3>PAPILIONID&AElig; (THE SWALLOWTAILS AND ALLIES)</h3>


<p>The butterflies of this family in both sexes are provided with
six ambulatory feet. The caterpillars are elongate, and in the
genera <i>Papilio</i> and <i>Ornithoptera</i> have osmateria, or protrusive
scent-organs, used for purposes of defense.</p>

<p>The chrysalids in all the genera are more or less elongate, attached
at the anal extremity, and held in place by a girdle of silk,
but they never lie appressed to the surface upon which pupation
takes place, as is true in the <i>Erycinid&aelig;</i> and <i>Lyc&aelig;nid&aelig;</i>.</p>

some cases six nervules, and the upper radial is lacking in this wing.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The eggs are spindle-shaped, marked with
vertical ridges and cross-lines. The caterpillars are cylindrical,
relatively long, generally green in color, longitudinally striped with
darker or paler lines. The chrysalids are generally more or less
pointed at the head, with the wing-cases in many of the genera
greatly developed on the ventral side, forming a deep, keel-shaped
projection upon this surface.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The butterflies are medium sized, varying much in
the form of wing, in some species greatly resembling other <i>Pierin&aelig;</i>
in outline, but more frequently resembling the Ithomiid and
Heliconiid butterflies, which they mimic. Some of them represent
transitional forms between the
type commonly represented in the genus
<i>Pieris</i> and the forms found in the two
above-mentioned protected groups. The
eyes are not prominent. The palpi are
quite small. The basal joint is long,
the middle joint oval, and the third joint
small, oval, or slightly club-shaped. The
antenn&aelig; are long, thin, terminating in a
gradually enlarged spindle-shaped club;
the fore wings being sometimes oval,
more frequently elongated, twice, or even
three times, as long as broad, especially in the male sex; the apex
pointed, falcate, or rounded. The cell is long and narrow. The
first subcostal vein varies as to location, rising either before or after
the end of the cell, and, in numerous cases, coalescing with the
costal vein, as is shown in the cut.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The egg is flask-shaped, fluted
on the sides, recalling the shape of the "pearl-top"
lamp-chimney. The caterpillar, in its mature
form, is about an inch long. The body is cylindrical,
terminating in two short anal tails. The color
is dark green, with a broad white band on each side,
and a narrow band of white on the back. The feet are black, and
the prolegs greenish-yellow. The chrysalis is dark green, striped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[ 275]</a></span>
with white, resembling the chrysalids of the genus <i>Colias</i>, but
somewhat more slender. The caterpillar feeds upon conifers. But
one species is known.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Neophasia menapia</b>, Felder, Plate XXXIV, Fig. 7, &#9794;

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The insect on the under side sometimes has the
outer margin of the secondaries marked with spots of bright pinkish-red,
resembling in this style of coloration certain species of
the genus <i>Delias</i> of the Indo-Malayan fauna.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been thoroughly described by Edwards
in his third volume. The caterpillar infests the pine-trees
and firs of the northern Pacific States. The larva lets itself down
by a silken thread, often a hundred feet in length, and pupates on
the ferns and shrubbery at the foot of the trees. It sometimes
works great damage to the pine woods.</p>

<p>This genus, which includes about seventy species, may be
distinguished from all other genera belonging to the <i>Pierin&aelig;</i> by the
two stiff brush-like clusters of hairs which are found in the male
sex attached to the abdominal clasps. All of the species belonging
to the genus are found in the Old World, with exception
of the species described in this book, which has a wide range
throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the New
World. The peculiarities of neuration are well shown in the
accompanying cut, in which the hind wing has been somewhat
unduly magnified in proportion to the fore wing.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The life-history of our species has not been
thoroughly studied, but we have ascertained enough of the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[ 276]</a></span>
stages of various species found in the tropics of the Old World
to know that there is a very close relationship between this genus
and that which follows in our classification.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Tachyris ilaire</b>, Godart, Plate
XXXV, Fig. 4, &#9794;; Fig. 5, &#9793; (The Florida

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The hind wings of the male
on the under side, which is not shown in
the plate, are very pale saffron. The under
side of the wings in the female is pearly-white,
marked with bright orange-yellow
at the base of the primaries. A melanic
form of the female sometimes occurs in
which the wings are almost wholly dull
blackish on both sides.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;We know, as yet, but
little of these.</p>

<p>The insect is universally abundant in
the tropics of America, and occurs in
southern Florida.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Medium-sized butterflies, white in color, marked
in many species on both the upper and under sides with dark
brown. The antenn&aelig; are distinctly clubbed, moderate in length.
The palpi are short, delicate, compressed, with the terminal joint
quite short and pointed. The subcostal vein of the primaries has
four branches, the first subcostal arising before the end of the cell,
the second at its upper outer angle, and the third and fourth from
a common stem emitted at the same point. The outer margin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[ 277]</a></span>
the primaries is straight, the outer margin of the secondaries more
or less evenly rounded.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is spindle-shaped, with vertical raised ridges.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;Elongate, the head hemispherical, very slightly,
if at all, larger in diameter than the body. The caterpillars feed
upon cruciferous plants.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;Attached by the anal extremity, and held in place
by a silk girdle; slightly concave on the ventral side; convex on
the dorsal side, with a distinct or pointed
hump-like projection on the thorax. At the
point where the thoracic and abdominal segments
unite in some species there is in addition
a distinct keel-shaped eminence, and at
the head the chrysalis is furnished with a short
conical projection.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Pieris monuste</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate
XXXV, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Fig. 2, &#9793; (The Great Southern
White).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side of the wings,
depicted in the plate, requires no comment.
On the under side the black marginal markings
of the primaries reappear as pale-brown markings. The hind
wing is pale yellow or grayish-saffron, crossed by an ill-defined
pale-brown transverse band of spots, and has the veins marked
with pale brown, and interspersed between them pale-brown rays
on the interspaces.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;What we know of these is derived principally
from Abbot through Boisduval, and there is opportunity here
for investigation.</p>

<p>The species has a wide range through tropical America, and
is not uncommon in the Gulf States.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Pieris beckeri</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXIV, Fig. 8, &#9794;; Fig.
9, &#9793; (Becker's White).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species, through the green markings of the
under side of the hind wings, concentrated in broad blotches on
the disk, recalls somewhat the species of the genus <i>Euchlo&euml;</i>, and
by these markings it may easily be discriminated from all other
allied species.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been in part described by Edwards
in the second volume of "The Butterflies of North America."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[ 278]</a></span></p>

<p>The species ranges from Oregon to central California, and
eastward to Colorado.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Pieris occidentalis</b>, Reakirt, Plate XXXIV, Fig. 13, &#9794;
(The Western White).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Not unlike the preceding species on the upper
side, but easily distinguished by the markings of the under side
of the wings, which are not concentrated in blotches, but extend
as broad longitudinal rays on either side of the veins from the base
to the outer margin.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These require further investigation. We do
not, as yet, know much about them.</p>

<p>The species has a wide range in the mountain States of the
West, where it replaces the Eastern <i>P. protodice</i>.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Pieris protodice</b>, Boisduval and Leconte, Plate XXXIV,
Fig. 10, &#9794;; Fig. 11, &#9793;; Plate II, Fig. 7, <i>larva</i>; Plate V, Figs. 66,
67, <i>chrysalis</i> (see also p. 12, Fig. 26) (The Common White).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Allied to the foregoing species, especially to <i>P.
occidentalis</i>; but it may always be quickly distinguished by the
pure, immaculate white color of the hind wings of the male on
the under side, and by the fact that in the female the hind wings
are more lightly marked along the veins by gray-green.</p>

<p>Winter form <b>vernalis</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXIV, Fig. 18, &#9794;.
What has been said of the typical or summer form does not hold
true of this winter form, which emerges from chrysalids which
have withstood the cold from autumn until spring. The butterflies
emerging from these are generally dwarfed in size, and in
the males have the dark spots on the upper side of the wings almost
obsolete or greatly reduced, and the dark markings along the
veins on the under side well developed, as in <i>P. occidentalis</i>.
The females, on the contrary, show little reduction in the size
and intensity of any of the spots, but rather a deepening of color,
except in occasional instances.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The life-history of this insect has often been
described. The caterpillar feeds upon cruciferous plants, like
many of its congeners.</p>

<p>It ranges from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains, from
Canada to the Gulf States.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Pieris sisymbri</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXXIV, Fig. 12, &#9794;
(The California White).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Smaller in size than the preceding species, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[ 279]</a></span>
the veins of the fore wing black, contrasting sharply with the
white ground-color. All the spots are smaller and more regular,
especially those on the outer margin of the fore wing, giving
the edge an evenly checkered appearance. On the under side the
hind wings have the veins somewhat widely bordered with gray,
interrupted about the middle of the wing by the divergence of
the lines on either side of the veins in such a way as to produce
the effect of a series of arrow-points with their barbs directed
toward the base. The female is like the male, with the markings
a little heavier. A yellow varietal form is sometimes found.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The life-history is given and illustrated by Edwards
in his second volume. The caterpillar, which is green,
banded with black, feeds upon the <i>Crucifer&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Pieris napi</b>, Esper, Plate II, Figs. 8, 9, <i>larva</i>; Plate V,
Figs. 57, 63, 64, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Mustard White).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This is a Protean species, of which there exist
many forms, the result of climatic and local influences. Even the
larva and chrysalis show in different regions slight microscopic
differences, for the influences which affect the imago are operative
also in the early stages of development. The typical form
which is found in Europe is rarely found in North America, though
I have specimens from the northern parts of the Pacific coast region
which are absolutely indistinguishable from European specimens
in color and markings. I give a few of the well-marked forms
or varieties found in North America to which names have been given.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Winter form <b>oleracea-hiemalis</b>, Harris, Plate XXXIV, Fig.
16, &#9794; (see also p. 5, Fig. 9, and p. 13, Fig. 27). The wings are white
above in both sexes. Below the fore wings are tipped with pale
yellow, and the entire hind wing is yellow. The veins at the apex
of the fore wings and on the hind wings are margined with dusky.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Aberrant form <b>virginiensis</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXIV, Fig.
14, &#9794;. The wings are white above, slightly tipped at the apex
of the fore wings with blackish. Below the wings are white,
faintly, but broadly, margined with pale dusky.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Form <b>pallida</b>, Scudder, Plate XXXIV, Fig. 15, &#9793;. In this
form the wings are white above and below, with a small black
spot on the fore wing of the female above, and hardly any trace
of dark shading along the veins on the under side.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Alpine or arctic form <b>bryoni&aelig;</b>, Ochsenheimer, Plate
XXXIV, Fig. 17, &#9793;. In this form, which is found in Alaska,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[ 280]</a></span>
Siberia, and the Alps of Europe, the veins above and below are
strongly bordered with blackish, and the ground-color of the
hind wings and the apex of the fore wings on the under side are
distinctly bright yellow.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Newfoundland variety <b>acadica</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXIV,
Fig. 19, &#9793;. This form is larger than the others, and in markings
intermediate between <i>pallida</i> and <i>bryoni&aelig;</i>. The under side in
both sexes and the upper side in the female are distinctly yellowish.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are well known and have often been
described, but some of the varietal forms need further study.</p>

<p>The species ranges from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from
Alaska to the northern limits of the Gulf States.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Pieris rap&aelig;</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate XXXV, Fig. 3, &#9793;; Plate II,
Figs. 11, 12, <i>larva</i>; Plate V, Figs. 58, 65, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Cabbage-butterfly).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This common species, which is a recent importation
from Europe, scarcely needs any description. It is familiar to
everyone. The story of its introduction and the way in which
it has spread over the continent has been well told by Dr. Scudder
in the second volume of "The Butterflies of New England,"
p. 1175. The insect reached Quebec about 1860. How it came
no man knows; perhaps in a lot of cabbages imported from
abroad; maybe a fertile female was brought over as a stowaway.
At all events, it came. Estimates show that a single female of this
species might be the progenitor in a few generations of millions.
In 1863 the butterfly was already common about Quebec, and was
spreading rapidly. By the year 1881 it had spread over the eastern
half of the continent, the advancing line of colonization reaching
from Hudson Bay to southern Texas. In 1886 it reached Denver,
as in 1884 it had reached the head waters of the Missouri, and it
now possesses the cabbage-fields from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
to the incalculable damage of all who provide the raw material for
sauer-kraut. The injury annually done by the caterpillar is estimated
to amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Two city fathers were standing in the market-place beside a

As he approached, a cabbage-butterfly, fluttering about the place
lit on the straw hat of one of the dignitaries. The naturalist, accosting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[ 281]</a></span>
him, said: "Friend, do you know what rests upon your
head?" "No," said he. "A butterfly." "Well," said he,
"that brings good luck." "Yes," replied the naturalist; "and
the insect reveals to me the wonderful instinct with which nature
has provided it." "How is that?" quoth the city father. "It is

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The butterfly is very small, yellow, margined with
black. The upper radial vein in the fore wing is wanting. The
subcostal has four nervules, the third and fourth
rising from a common stalk emitted from the
upper outer corner of the cell, the first and second
from before the end of the cell. The precostal
vein on the hind wing is reduced to a small
swelling beyond the base. The palpi are slender;
the third joint long and curved; the second
joint oval; the third fine, spindle-shaped, and
pointed. The antenn&aelig; are rather short, with a
somewhat thick and abruptly developed club.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Euchlo&euml; sara</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXXII, Fig. 28, &#9794;; Fig.

shown in the figures above cited. On the under side the hind
wings are marked with dark irregular patches of greenish-brown
scales loosely scattered over the surface, and having a "mossy"

<p>There are several forms which are regarded by recent writers
as varieties and may probably be such. Of these we give the
following:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Variety <b>reakirti</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXII, Fig. 31, &#9794;; Fig.
32, &#9793; (Reakirt's Orange-tip) = <b>flora</b>, Wright, Plate XXXIV, Fig.
4, &#9794;; Fig. 5, &#9793;. This form hardly differs at all from the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[ 283]</a></span>
<i>sara</i>, except in being smaller, and having the margins of the hind
wings marked with dark spots at the ends of the veins.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Variety <b>Stella</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXII, Fig. 35, &#9794;; Fig.
36, &#9793; (Stella). The females of this form are prevalently yellowish
on the upper side of the wings; otherwise they are marked
exactly as the preceding variety.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Variety <b>julia</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXII, Fig. 34, &#9794;; Plate
XXXIV, Fig. 6, &#9793;, <i>under side</i> (Julia). The only distinction in
this form is the fact that the black bar dividing the red apical patch
from the white on the remainder of the wing is broken, or tends
to diminution at its middle.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The species, in all its forms, belongs to the mountain States
of the Pacific coast. <i>Flora</i>, Wright, is regarded by Beutenm&uuml;ller,
who has given us the latest revision of the genus, as identical with
<i>sara</i>. It comes nearer the variety <i>reakirti</i> than any other form, as
will be seen by an examination of the plates which give figures of
the types. Expanse, 1.25-1.75 inch.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Euchlo&euml; ausonides</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXXII, Fig. 24, &#9794;;
Fig. 25, &#9793;; Plate XXXIV, Fig. 3, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (Ausonides).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;On the under side the fore wings are greenish; the
hind wings are marked with three irregular green bands, the
outer one forking into six or seven branches toward the outer
and inner margins. Expanse, 1.65-1.90 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The larva and chrysalis are described by Edwards
in "The Butterflies of North America," vol. ii. The caterpillar
is pale whitish-green, with dark-green longitudinal stripes

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This delicate little insect, for the identification of
which the plates will abundantly serve, has been regarded as
existing in two varietal forms, one of which has been named
after the indefatigable collector Morrison, whose death is still
lamented by the elder generation of American entomologists.
The varietal form is characterized by the heavier green markings
of the under side of the wings. Expanse, 1.25-1.40 inch.</p>

Fig. 6, p. 4, <i>egg</i> (The Falcate Orange-tip).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is readily recognized by the decidedly
falcate tip of the fore wings. The first brood appears in early
spring. It is single-brooded in the Northern States, but is double-brooded
in the western portions of North Carolina, where I have
taken it quite abundantly late in the autumn. Expanse, 1.30-1.50
inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The life-history is well known. The caterpillar
feeds on <i>Sisymbrium</i>, <i>Arabis</i>, <i>Cardamine</i>, and other cruciferous
plants.</p>

<p>It ranges from New England to Texas, but is not found, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[ 285]</a></span>

<p>(8) <b>Euchlo&euml; lanceolata</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXXII, Fig. 30,
&#9794; (Boisduval's Marble).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The figure gives a correct idea of the upper surface
of the male. The female on the upper side is marked with
light-black spots on the outer margin near the apex. On the
under side in both sexes the apex of the primaries and the entire
surface of the secondaries, except a small spot on the costa, are
profusely sprinkled with small brown scales. The veins of the hind
wing are brown. Expanse, 1.65-1.95 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar, which feeds upon <i>Turritis</i>, is
green, shaded on the sides with pale blue, striped laterally with
white, and covered with transverse rows of minute black points,
each bearing a short black bristle. We know nothing of the
other stages.</p>

<p>The species ranges from northern California to Alaska.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Large butterflies, brilliant lemon-yellow or orange-yellow,
marked with a few darker spots and with a narrow band
of brown, especially in the female sex, on the outer margin of the
primaries. They are very quick and vigorous in flight, more so
than is the case in any of the preceding genera.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs are spindle-shaped, flat at the base, and acutely
pointed, with a few longitudinal ribs and a multitude of delicate
cross-lines.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is relatively long, with the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[ 286]</a></span>
small; the segments somewhat moniliform, resembling beads
strung together, the surface covered with a multitude of minute
papill&aelig; ranged in transverse rows.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is strongly concave on the dorsal side,
with the head greatly produced as a long, pointed, conical projection;
the wing-cases are compressed and
form a very wide, keel-shaped projection
on the ventral side. This peculiar formation
of the wing-cases reaches its greatest
development in this genus.</p>

<p>The butterflies of this genus are mainly
tropical. Four or five species, however,
are found in the warmer parts of the United

as northern New Jersey, and has been occasionally
taken even in northern Illinois.</p>

being very abundant in the tropics, where it congregates in great
swarms upon moist places by the side of streams. It haunts in
great numbers the orange-groves of the South, and is very fond
of flowers. It is rare on the northern limits of its range, though
quite common on the coast of New Jersey. Expanse, 2.50 inches.
The caterpillar feeds on leguminous plants, but especially upon the
different species of <i>Cassia</i>.</p>

which includes some of the showiest insects of the subfamily.
It may be readily recognized by the bar of deep orange crossing the
cell of the primaries, and by the orange tint on the outer margin
of the hind wings. Expanse, 3.00-3.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;But little is as yet known of these. The larva
feeds on the same kinds of plants as the larva of <i>C. eubule</i>. It occurs
in Texas, and is said to have also been found in Illinois as a straggler.

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is spindle-shaped, thickest at the middle, tapering
at the apex and at the base, generally attached by an enlarged

<p>This genus is very extensive, being represented throughout
the temperate regions of both hemispheres, and also occurring in
the cooler portions of South America, especially along the ranges
of the Andes. One species is found in temperate South Africa.
The brightly colored butterflies, which are sometimes found congregating

on the under side. The discal spot on the lower side is centered
with green. Expanse, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The life-history has been written by Edwards,

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is discriminated from the preceding
principally by the narrower black margins on the wings of the
male and the more abundant yellow maculation of the borders in
the female. Expanse, 1.55-1.90 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Closely resembling those of the preceding species,

V, Fig. 53, <i>chrysalis</i> (Eurytheme).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species has been made in recent years the
subject of exhaustive study, and has been discovered to be
strongly polymorphic&mdash;that is to say, liable to great variation.
Not only does albinism assert itself in the production of white
forms, but there are many seasonal and climatic forms. We are
not yet through with our studies, and there is doubtless much
more to be ascertained. The figures cited above represent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[ 291]</a></span>
typical form of the species. We have given, in addition to these,
the following forms:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Winter form <b>ariadne</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXVI, Fig. 7, &#9794;;
Fig. 8, &#9793;. This form, emerging from chrysalids which have
overwintered, is like the type in having the fore wings tinged
with orange. Expanse, 1.75 inch.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Winter form <b>keewaydin</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXVI, Fig. 9,
&#9794;; Fig. 10, &#9793;. This is a larger form, more deeply flushed with
orange, though not quite as deeply as shown in the plate. Expanse,
1.85 inch.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Summer form <b>eriphyle</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXV, Fig. 15, &#9794;;
Plate XLIII, Fig. 3, &#9794;, <i>under side</i>. This summer form differs from
typical <i>C. eurytheme</i> in being yellow and not laved with orange.
Expanse, 2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar feeds on clover, as do most of
the species of the genus.</p>

<p>The range of <i>eurytheme</i> is very wide. It extends from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, and from Canada to the far South, though
rare in the lower parts of Florida and Texas in the hot lands.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Colias philodice</b>, Godart, Plate I (Frontispiece), Fig. 4,

<i>chrysalis</i> (The Common Sulphur).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;We are all familiar with this species, the "puddle
butterfly" of our childhood, which sits in swarms on moist
places by the wayside, and makes the clover-fields gay with the
flash of yellow wings in summer. There are many aberrational
forms, albinos and negroes, white forms and dark forms, dwarfed
forms and large forms, but in the main the species is remarkably
constant, and seasonal forms and distinctly local races do not
abound as in the case of the preceding species. Expanse, &#9794;,
1.25-1.80 inch; &#9793;, 1.60-2.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The food-plant is clover. The eggs are pale
yellow, changing, after being laid, to crimson. The caterpillar
is slender, green, striped longitudinally with paler green. The
chrysalis is pale green.</p>

side is bright lemon-yellow, with broad black margins on both
wings. The female is paler, with the black margin of the hind
wing lacking or very faintly indicated, and the margin of the
fore wing much broken up by yellow spots. On the under side
the wings of the male are dusky-orange, pale yellow on the disk
of the primaries; the wings of the female on this side are pale
yellow. Expanse, &#9794;, 2.00-2.10 inches; &#9793;, 2.25-2.30 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Undescribed.</p>

<p>The home of this species is on the Coast Range of northern

<p>(6) <b>Colias alexandra</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXV, Fig. 6, &#9794;; Fig.
7, &#9793; (The Alexandra Sulphur).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Larger than <i>C. philodice</i>. The male is pale canary-yellow,
with much narrower black borders than the preceding
species. The female is pale yellow or white, without black borders,
or, at most, faint traces of them at the apex of the primaries.
On the under side the wings are silvery-gray, yellow
only at the base and on the inner margin of the primaries. The
discal spot on the hind wings is white. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.85 inch;
&#9793;, 2.10-2.30 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is uniformly yellowish-green,
with a white band on each side, broken with orange-red dashes
running through it. The chrysalis, which resembles that of <i>C.
philodice</i> in form, is yellowish-green, darkest on the dorsal side,
and adorned with three small red dots on the ventral side of the
abdomen near the wing-cases. The caterpillar eats <i>Astragalus</i>,
<i>Thermopsis</i>, and white clover. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.90-2.15 inches;
&#9793;, 2.00-2.30 inches.</p>

<p>The species is found in Colorado and the mountain regions
to the north and west of that State.</p>

&#9793; (The Pink-edged Sulphur).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side closely resembles <i>C.
philodice</i>, but is smaller, the fringes of the wings rose-colored.
The female is pale yellow above, more frequently white, with the
tips of the fore wings lightly marked with blackish. On the
under side the fore wings at the apex and the entire surface of
the hind wings are rusty orange-yellow. The discal spot on the
hind wings is silvery, bordered with rosy-red. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.30-1.75
inch; &#9793;, 1.60-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[ 293]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Little is as yet known of these.</p>

<p>The species was first found by Professor Louis Agassiz on the
north shore of Lake Superior. It ranges through a rather narrow
belt of country, through Quebec, Ontario, and westward to the
Rocky Mountains north of the valley of the St. Lawrence and the
Great Lakes.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Colias scudderi</b>, Reakirt, Plate XXXV, Fig. 8, &#9794;; Fig. 9,
&#9793; (Scudder's Sulphur).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side is colored like <i>C. philodice</i>,
but the black borders are much wider. The fringes are
rosy. The female is generally white,&mdash;very rarely slightly yellow,&mdash;with
very pale dark borders, or often without any trace
of black on the outer margin of the wings. On the under side
the apex of the fore wings and the entire surface of the hind
wings are greenish-gray. The discal spot of the secondaries is well
silvered and margined with pale red. Expanse, 1.80-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;We know but little of these, except that the
caterpillar feeds on the leaves of the huckleberry and the willow.</p>

<p>Scudder's Sulphur is found in Colorado, Utah, Montana, and
British Columbia.</p>

<p>(9) <i>Colias pelidne</i>, Boisduval, Plate XXXV, Fig. 14, &#9794;;
Plate XXXVI, Fig. 15, &#9794;; Fig. 16, &#9793; (The Labrador Sulphur).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side is pale yellow, with a
greenish tinge on the hind wings; the black borders are narrow; the
fringes are pink. The female on the upper side is white, with very
little or no black on the outer borders, the black marking being confined
to the apex of the fore wings. On the under side the wings are
much as in <i>C. interior</i>, and it is possible that the two forms are
varieties of one and the same species. Expanse, 1.60-1.85 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Little is known of these.</p>

<p><i>Pelidne</i> is rather abundant in Labrador at the proper season,
and ranges thence westward and northward in boreal America.</p>

<p>(10) <b>Colias nastes</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXXVI, Fig. 11, &#9794;;
Fig. 12, &#9793; (The Arctic Sulphur).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily recognized in both sexes by the pale-greenish
tint of the wings and the tendency of the outer border of the
fore wings of the male to become divided, like those of the female,
by a band of pale spots. Expanse, 1.50-1.65 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This is an arctic species, which is found in Labrador, Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[ 294]</a></span>land,
the far North in British America and Alaska, and on the
summits of the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia.</p>

<p>(11) <b>Colias behri</b>, Edwards, Plate XXXVI, Fig. 17, &#9794; (Behr's
Sulphur).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This very rare little species may be easily recognized
by the dark-greenish tint of the upper side of the wings and the
light spot on the upper side of the hind wings. The female has
the outer borders dusky like the male, the dusky shade running inward
on the lines of the veins and nervules. Expanse, 1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;We know little of these.</p>

<p>The insect has hitherto been taken only at considerable elevations
among the Western Sierras, and the peaks and lofty meadows
about the Yosemite Valley have been until recently the
classic locality for the species.</p>

<p>There are a number of other species of the genus <i>Colias</i>, and
numerous varieties which have been named and described from
the western and northwestern portions of our region; but it requires
almost as much skill to distinguish them as is required to
discriminate between the different species of willows, asters, and
goldenrods, among plants, and we do not think it worth while
to burden the student with an account of these, and of the controversies
which are being waged about them. If any reader of
this book becomes entangled in perplexities concerning the species
of <i>Colias</i>, the writer will be glad to try to aid him to correct conclusions
by personal conference or correspondence.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Small butterflies, bright orange or yellow, margined
with black. They are more delicate in structure and have
thinner wings than most of the genera belonging to the subfamily
of the <i>Pierin&aelig;</i>. The outer margin of the wings is generally straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[ 295]</a></span>
or slightly rounded, though in a few species the apex is somewhat
acuminate. The outer margin of the hind wings

</div>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Strongly spindle-shaped, pointed and
rounded at the base and at the apex, much swollen
at the middle, its sides marked by numerous
broad but slightly raised vertical ridges.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillars are small,
relatively long, cylindrical, with the head quite
small, the thoracic segments somewhat larger
than the others, giving the anterior portion of
the body a slightly humped appearance. They
feed upon leguminous plants.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is compressed laterally, with the
head pointed and the wing-cases forming a deep, keel-shaped
projection on the ventral side, more pronounced than in any other
genus except <i>Catopsilia</i>.</p>

<p>There are an immense number of species belonging to this
genus scattered through the tropical and subtropical regions of
both hemispheres. Many of the species are dimorphic or polymorphic,
and much confusion has arisen, especially in relation to
the Oriental species, on account of the great tendency to the production
of seasonal varieties, many of which are strikingly different
from one another.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Terias gundlachia</b>, Poey, Plate XXXVII, Fig. 1, &#9794;
(Gundlach's Sulphur).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is easily recognized by the orange-yellow
tint of the upper side of the wings and the sharply
pointed hind wings. Expanse, 1.80 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;We know nothing of these.</p>

<p>The species is found in Texas, Arizona, Mexico, and Cuba.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Terias proterpia</b>, Fabricius, Plate XXXVII, Fig. 2, &#9794;
(<i>Proterpia</i>).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Even deeper orange than the preceding species.
The hind wings are, however, less pointed; the veins and nervules
are black at their ends, and the costal margin of the fore
wings is evenly bordered with black, which does not run down
on the outer margin as in <i>T. gundlachia</i>. Expanse, 1.50-1.75 inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[ 296]</a></span></p>

6, <i>larva</i>; Plate V, Figs. 51, 52, <i>chrysalis</i> (Nicippe).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The plate gives so full a presentation of this common
species as to make a lengthy description unnecessary. It is
subject to considerable variation. I have specimens of many
varying shades of orange and yellow, and a few albino females.
The orange form depicted in Plate XXXVII, Figs. 3 and 4, is
typical. The form <i>flava</i> is not uncommon. Expanse, 1.50-2.00
inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are not as well known as they should
be in view of the excessive abundance of the insect in long-settled
parts of the country. The caterpillar feeds upon <i>Cassia</i> in
preference to all other plants, but will eat other leguminos&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>Nicippe</i> is very rare in New England, but is common south
of latitude 40&deg; as far as the Rocky Mountains, and ranges over
Cuba, Mexico, and Guatemala, into Venezuela and even Brazil.
It fairly swarms at times in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Kentucky,
and southern Indiana and Illinois. I have encountered clouds
of it on the wing near Jeffersonville, Indiana, and thence north
along the lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad as far as Seymour.
It is not common in western Pennsylvania, but in former years
was taken rather frequently about Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Terias mexicana</b>, Plate XXXVII, Fig. 7, &#9794;; Fig. 8, &#9793;,
<i>under side</i> (The Mexican Yellow).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished from all other species in our
fauna by the pointed hind wings, margined on the outer border
with black, and by the heavy black border of the fore wings,
deeply excised inwardly, recalling the fore wing of the species
of the genus <i>Meganostoma</i>. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.75 inch; &#9793;, 1.85 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;We do not, as yet, know much about these.</p>

<p><i>T. mexicana</i> is very common in Arizona, and occurs also in
Texas. It is abundant in Mexico.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Terias damaris</b>, Felder, Plate XXXVII, Fig. 9, &#9794;; Fig.
10, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (Damaris).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Allied to the preceding species, but readily distinguished
from it by the less deeply excised outer border of the fore
wing, by the fact that the black outer margin of the secondaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[ 297]</a></span>
extends inwardly beyond the angulated point of the wing, and
by the different color and style of the markings of the lower side.
Expanse, 1.35-1.65 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p><i>Damaris</i> occurs in Arizona, and thence ranges south into
Venezuela.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Terias westwoodi.</b> Boisduval, Plate XXXVII, Fig. 11, &#9794;
(Westwood's Yellow).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Pale yellow or orange-yellow, with a narrow
black border on the fore wings, beginning on the costa beyond
the middle, and not quite reaching the inner angle. On the
under side the wings are pale yellow, immaculate, or at the apex
of the fore wing and the outer angle of the hind wing broadly
marked with very pale reddish-brown. Expanse, 1.75-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>Westwood's Yellow occurs in Texas and Arizona, but is not
common. It is abundant farther south.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Terias lisa</b>, Boisduval and Leconte, Plate XXXVII, Fig.
13, &#9794;; Plate II, Fig. 3, <i>larva</i>; Plate V, Fig. 56, <i>chrysalis</i> (The
Little Sulphur).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Allied to the three following species, from which
it may at once be distinguished by the absence of the black bar
on the inner margin of the fore wings and by the profusely
mottled surface of the under side of the hind wings. It is subject
to considerable variation, albino females and melanic males being
sometimes found, as well as dwarfed specimens of very small
size. Expanse, 1.25-1.60 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have not been thoroughly studied and
described, in spite of the fact that the insect is very common in
many easily accessible localities. The caterpillar feeds on <i>Cassia</i>
and on clover.</p>

<p><i>T. lisa</i> ranges from New England south and west as far as the
foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains, and into Mexico and Honduras.
It is found in the Antilles and Bermuda. An interesting account
of the appearance of a vast swarm of these butterflies in the
Bermudas is given by Jones in "Psyche," vol. i, p. 121:</p>

<p>"Early in the morning of the first day of October last year
(1874), several persons living on the north side of the main island
perceived, as they thought, a cloud coming over from the
northwest, which drew nearer and nearer to the shore, on reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[ 298]</a></span>ing
which it divided into two parts, one of which went eastward,
and the other westward, gradually falling upon the land. They
were not long in ascertaining that what they had taken for a cloud
was an immense concourse of small yellow butterflies (<i>Terias
lisa</i>, Boisduval), which flitted about all the open grassy patches
and cultivated grounds in a lazy manner, as if fatigued after their
long voyage over the deep. Fishermen out near the reefs, some
few miles to the north of the island, very early that morning,
stated that numbers of these insects fell upon their boats, literally
covering them. They did not stay long upon the islands, however,
only a few days, but during that time thousands must have
fallen victims to the vigorous appetite of the bluebird (<i>Sialia sialis</i>,
Baird) and blackbird (<i>Mimus carolinensis</i>, Gray), which were
continually preying upon them."</p>

<p>As the nearest point of land is Cape Hatteras, about six hundred
miles distant, it is seen that, weak and feeble as this little
creature appears, it must possess, when aided by favoring winds,
great power of sustained flight.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Terias elathea</b>, Cramer, Plate XXXVII, Fig. 12, &#9794; (Elathea).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Distinguished from its near ally, <i>T. delia</i>, by the
fact that the ground-color of the hind wings is white. The female
in this, as in the allied species, is without the black bar on
the inner margin of the primaries. Expanse, 1.25-1.40 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p><i>Elathea</i> is found in Florida, Mexico, and the Antilles.</p>

<p>(9) <b>Terias delia</b>, Cramer, Plate XXXVII, Fig. 14, &#9794; (Delia).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Almost exactly like the preceding species, but having
the upper side of the hind wings yellow. On the under side
the fore wing at the tip and the entire hind wing are red. Expanse,
1.25-1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;But little is known of them. The caterpillar
feeds on <i>Cassia</i>.</p>

<p><i>Delia</i> occurs commonly in the Gulf States.</p>

<p>(10) <b>Terias jucunda</b>, Boisduval and Leconte, Plate XXXVII,
Fig. 15, &#9794;; Fig. 16, &#9794;, <i>under side</i> (The Fairy Yellow).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Distinguished from the preceding species by the
dark marginal band surrounding the hind wing and the pale under
surface. Expanse, 1.60-1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This little species is found in the Gulf States.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>RED RAIN</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[ 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"The lepidopterous insects in general, soon after they emerge
from the pupa state, and commonly during their first flight, discharge
some drops of a red-colored fluid, more or less intense in
different species, which, in some instances, where their numbers
have been considerable, have produced the appearance of
a 'shower of blood,' as this natural phenomenon is sometimes
called.</p>

<p>"Showers of blood have been recorded by historians and
poets as preternatural&mdash;have been considered in the light of prodigies,
and regarded, where they have happened, as fearful prognostics
of impending evil.</p>

<p>"There are two passages in Homer, which, however poetical,
are applicable to a rain of this kind; and among the prodigies
which took place after the death of the great dictator, Ovid particularly
mentions a shower of blood:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ni">"'S&aelig;pe faces vis&aelig; mediis ardere sub astris,</span>
<span class="ni">S&aelig;pe inter nimbos gutt&aelig; cecidere cruent&aelig;.'</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="ni">"('With threatening signs the lowering skies were fill'd,</span>
<span class="ni">And sanguine drops from murky clouds distilled.')</span>
</div></div>

<p>"Among the numerous prodigies reported by Livy to have
happened in the year 214 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, it is instanced that at Mantua a
stagnating piece of water, caused by the overflowing of the river
Mincius, appeared as of blood; and in the cattle-market at Rome
a shower of blood fell in the Istrian Street. After mentioning
several other remarkable phenomena that happened during that
year, Livy concludes by saying that these prodigies were expiated,
conformably to the answers of the aruspices, by victims of
the greater kinds, and supplication was ordered to be performed
to all the deities who had shrines at Rome. Again, it is stated by
Livy that many alarming prodigies were seen at Rome in the
year 181 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and others reported from abroad; among which
was a shower of blood which fell in the courts of the temples of
Vulcan and Concord. After mentioning that the image of Juno
Sospita shed tears, and that a pestilence broke out in the country,
this writer adds that these prodigies, and the mortality which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[ 300]</a></span>
prevailed, alarmed the Senate so much that they ordered the
consuls to sacrifice to such gods as their judgment should direct
victims of the larger kinds, and that the decemvirs should consult
their books. Pursuant to their direction, a supplication for one
day was proclaimed to be performed at every shrine in Rome;
and they advised, besides, and the Senate voted, and the consul
proclaimed, that there should be a supplication and public worship
for three days throughout all Italy. In the year 169 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, Livy
also mentions that a shower of blood fell in the middle of the day.
The decemvirs were again called upon to consult their books,
and again were sacrifices offered to the deities. The account,
also, of Livy, of the bloody sweat on some of the statues of the
gods, must be referred to the same phenomenon, as the predilection
of those ages to marvel, says Thomas Browne, and the want
of accurate investigation in the cases recorded, as well as the rare
occurrence of these atmospherical depositions in our own times,
inclines us to include them among the blood-red drops deposited
by insects.</p>

<p>"In Stow's 'Annales of England' we have two accounts of
showers of blood, and from an edition printed in London in
1592, we make our quotations: 'Rivallus, sonne of Cunedagius,
succeeded his father, in whose time (in the year 766 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) it
rained bloud three dayes: after which tempest ensued a great
multitude of venemous flies, which slew much people, and then
a great mortalitie throughout this lande, caused almost desolation
of the same.' The second account is as follows: 'In the time
of Brithricus (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 786) it rayned blood, which falling on men's
clothes, appeared like crosses.'</p>

<p>"Hollingshed, Grafton, and Fabyan have also recorded these
instances in their respective chronicles of England.</p>

<p>"A remarkable instance of bloody rain is introduced into the
very interesting Icelandic ghost-story of Thorgunna. It appears
that in the year of our Lord 1009 a woman called Thorgunna
came from the Hebrides to Iceland, where she stayed at the house
of Thorodd; and during the hay season a shower of blood fell,
but only, singularly, on that portion of the hay she had not piled
up as her share, which so appalled her that she betook herself to
her bed, and soon afterward died. She left, to finish the story, a
remarkable will, which, from not being executed, was the cause
of several violent deaths, the appearance of ghosts, and, finally, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[ 301]</a></span>
legal action of ejectment against the ghosts, which, it need hardly
be said, drove them effectually away.</p>

<p>"In 1017 a shower of blood fell in Aquitaine; and Sleidan relates
that in the year 1553 a vast multitude of butterflies swarmed
through a great part of Germany, and sprinkled plants, leaves,
buildings, clothes, and men with bloody drops, as if it had
rained blood. We learn also from Bateman's 'Doome' that
these 'drops of bloude upon hearbes and trees' in 1553 were
deemed among the forewarnings of the deaths of Charles and
Philip, dukes of Brunswick.</p>

<p>"In Frankfort, in the year 1296, among other prodigies, some
spots of blood led to a massacre of the Jews, in which ten thousand
of these unhappy descendants of Abraham lost their lives.</p>

<p>"In the beginning of July, 1608, an extensive shower of blood
took place at Aix, in France, which threw the people of that place
into the utmost consternation, and, which is a much more important
fact, led to the first satisfactory and philosophical explanation
of this phenomenon, but too late, alas! to save the Jews of
Frankfort. This explanation was given by M. Peiresc, a celebrated
philosopher of that place, and is thus referred to by his
biographer, Gassendi: 'Nothing in the whole year 1608 did
more please him than that he observed and philosophized about,
the <i>bloody rain</i>, which was commonly reported to have fallen
about the beginning of July; great drops thereof were plainly to
be seen, both in the city itself, upon the walls of the churchyard
of the church, which is near the city wall, and upon the city walls
themselves; also upon the walls of villages, hamlets, and towns,
for some miles round about; for in the first place, he went himself
to see those wherewith the stones were coloured, and did what
he could to come to speak with those husbandmen, who, beyond
Lambesk, were reported to have been affrighted at the falling of
said rain, that they left their work, and ran as fast as their legs
could carry them into the adjacent houses. Whereupon, he found
that it was a fable that was reported, touching those husbandmen.
Nor was he pleased that naturalists should refer this kind of rain
to vapours drawn up out of red earth aloft in the air, which congealing
afterwards into liquor, fall down in this form; because
such vapours as are drawne aloft by heat, ascend without colour,
as we may know by the alone example of red roses, out of which
the vapours that arise by heat are congealed into transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[ 302]</a></span>
water. He was less pleased with the common people, and some
divines, who judged that it was the work of the devils and
witches who had killed innocent young children; for this he
counted a mere conjecture, possibly also injurious to the goodness
and providence of God.</p>

<p>"'In the meanwhile an accident happened, out of which he
conceived he had collected the true cause thereof. For, some
months before, he shut up in a box a certain palmer-worm which
he had found, rare for its bigness and form; which, when he had
forgotten, he heard a buzzing in the box, and when he opened it,
found the palmer-worm, having cast its coat, to be turned into
a beautiful Butterfly, which presently flew away, leaving in the
bottom of the box a red drop as broad as an ordinary sous or
shilling; and because this happened about the beginning of the
same month and about the same time an incredible multitude
of Butterflies were observed flying in the air, he was therefore of
opinion that such kind of Butterflies resting on the walls had
there shed such like drops, and of the same bigness. Whereupon,
he went the second time, and found, by experience, that
those drops were not to be found on the housetops, nor upon
the round sides of the stones which stuck out, as it would have
happened, if blood had fallen from the sky, but rather where the
stones were somewhat hollowed, and in holes, where such small
creatures might shroud and nestle themselves. Moreover, the
walls which were so spotted, were not in the middle of towns,
but they were such as bordered upon the fields, nor were they
on the highest parts, but only so moderately high as Butterflies
are commonly wont to fly.</p>

<p>"'Thus, therefore, he interpreted that which Gregory of Tours
relates touching a bloody rain seen at Paris in divers places, in
the days of Childebert, and on a certain house in the territory of
Senlis; also that which is storied, touching raining of blood about
the end of June, in the days of King Robert; so that the blood
which fell upon flesh, garments or stones could not be washed
out, but that which fell on wood might; for it was the same
season of Butterflies, and experience hath taught us, that no water
will wash these spots out of the stones, while they are fresh and
new. When he had said these and such like things to various,
a great company of auditors being present, it was agreed that
they should go together and search out the matter, and as they
went up and down, here and there, through the fields, they found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[ 303]</a></span>
many drops upon stones and rocks; but they were only on the
hollow and under parts of the stones, but not upon those which
lay most open to the skies.'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XXXVIII">Plate XXXVIII</a>.</span></div>

<p>"This memorable shower of blood was produced by the <i>Vanessa
urtic&aelig;</i> or <i>V. polychloros</i>, most probably, since these species
of butterflies are said to have been uncommonly plentiful at
the time when, and in the particular district where, the phenomenon
was observed."</p>

<h3>SUBFAMILY PAPILIONIN&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Generally large, and often with the hind wings
adorned by tail-like projections. The most characteristic structural
feature of the group is the absence of the internal vein of
the hind wings. The submedian vein occupies the position usually
held in other subfamilies by the internal.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;In that portion of the group which includes
the genus <i>Parnassius</i> and its allies, the caterpillars are not, so far
as is known, provided with scent-organs, and pupation takes
place upon the ground, or among loosely scattered leaves, which
are interwoven, at the time of pupation, with a few strands of
silk. The genus <i>Papilio</i> and its allies have large, fleshy, more or
less cylindrical caterpillars, possessed of osmateria, or offensive
scent-organs, and a general resemblance runs through the chrysalids
of all species, which are attached by a button of silk at the
anal extremity and supported in the middle by a silk girdle.</p>

apex. The upper radial is lacking. The subcostal is five-branched,
the third, fourth, and fifth nervules being
emitted from a common stalk which
springs from the upper outer angle of the
cell. The first subcostal nervule rises
well before the end of the cell; the second
from the same point from which the stalk
which bears the other three nervules
springs. The cell of the hind wing is
evenly rounded at its outer extremity.
The inner margin of the hind wing is
more or less excavated.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The egg is turban-shaped,
flattened, profusely covered
with small elevations, giving it a shagreened
appearance. The caterpillars
have very small heads. They are flattened,
having a somewhat leech-like appearance; they are black
or dark brown in color, marked with numerous light spots. The
chrysalis is short, rounded at the head, and pupation takes place
on the surface of the ground, among leaves and litter, a few loose
threads of silk being spun about the spot in which transformation
occurs.</p>

<p>The butterflies of this genus are classified with the <i>Papilionin&aelig;</i>,
because of the fact that the internal vein of the hind wings is
always wanting, a characteristic of all papilionine genera.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Generally large, frequently with the hind wings
tailed. A figure of the neuration characteristic of this genus is
given on p. 20, Fig. 38. From this it will be seen that the internal
vein of the hind wing is lacking, the submedian vein occupying
the space which is commonly occupied by the internal
vein. The median vein of the fore wing is connected with the
submedian by a short vein, from the point of union of which with
the submedian there proceeds a short internal vein in this wing.
There is great diversity of form in the wings of this genus, some
species even mimicking the species of the <i>Eupl&oelig;in&aelig;</i> and <i>Heliconiid&aelig;</i>
very closely, and being entirely without tails. In all cases,
however, in spite of obvious diversities in color and in form,
there is substantial anatomical agreement in the structure of the
wings; and the caterpillars and chrysalids reveal very strongly
marked affinities throughout the whole vast assemblage of species,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[ 307]</a></span>
which at the present time includes about five hundred distinct
forms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XXXIX">Plate XXXIX</a>.</span></div>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The eggs are somewhat globular, flattened at
the base, and smooth. The caterpillars are cylindrical, smooth,
fleshy, thicker in the anterior portion of the body than in the
posterior portion, and are always provided with osmateria, or
protrusive scent-organs, which, when the larva is alarmed, are
thrust forth, and emit a musky odor, not highly disagreeable to
the human nostrils, but evidently intended to deter other creatures
from attacking them. The chrysalids are always attached by a
button of silk at the anal extremity, and held in place by a girdle
of silk about the middle. The chrysalids are, however, never
closely appressed to the surface upon which pupation takes
place.</p>

<p>There are about twenty-seven species of this genus found
within the limits of boreal America. Our fauna is therefore much
richer in these magnificently colored and showy butterflies than
is the fauna of all Europe, in which but three species are known
from the Dardanelles to the North Cape and Gibraltar. The genus
is wonderfully developed in the tropics both of the New and
the Old World, and has always been a favorite with collectors,
containing many of the largest as well as the handsomest insects
of the order.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Papilio ajax</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate II, Fig. 14, <i>larva</i>; Plate VI,
Figs. 11, 12, <i>chrysalis</i> (Ajax).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This insect, which is one of the most beautiful
in our fauna, has been the subject of attentive study in recent
years, and is now known to be seasonally polymorphic. We
have given in Plate XLIV figures of several of the forms.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Winter form <b>walshi</b>; Edwards, Plate XLIV, Fig. 4, &#9794;.
In this form, which emerges from chrysalids which have been
exposed to the cold of the winter, the black bands of the wings
are narrower and a trifle paler than in the other forms, the tails
of the hind wing tipped with white, and the crimson spot on
the inner margin near the anal angle forming a conspicuous bent
bar. A variety of this form, with a more or less distinct crimson
line parallel to the inner margin on the upper side of the hind
wing, has been named <i>Papilio ajax</i>, var. <i>abbotti</i>, by Edwards.</p>

<p>Another winter form, for which I propose the name <b>floriden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[ 308]</a></span>sis</b>, is
represented in Plate XLIV, Fig. 2, by a male specimen. It
is characterized by the great breadth and intensity of the black
bands on the upper side of the wings, which are quite as broad
as in the summer form <i>marcellus</i>. I find this form prevalent in
the spring of the year on the St. Johns River, in Florida. Expanse,
2.50-2.75 inches.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Winter form <b>telamonides</b>, Felder, Plate XLIV, Fig. 1, &#9794;.
In this form the tails of the hind wings are somewhat longer
than in <i>walshi</i>, and are not simply tipped, but bordered on either
side for half their length with white, and the red spots near the
anal angle do not coalesce to form a crimson bar, but are separate.
The black transverse bands on the upper side are wider
than in <i>walshi</i>. Expanse, 2.75-3.00 inches.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Summer form <b>marcellus</b>, Boisduval, Plate XLIV, Fig.
3, &#9794;. In this form, which represents the second generation emerging
in the summer and fall from chrysalids produced from eggs
of <i>walshi</i>, <i>floridensis</i>, and <i>telamonides</i>, the tails of the hind wings
are greatly lengthened, being fully twice as long as in <i>walshi</i>, the
black bands are greatly widened, and there is but a single small
spot of crimson (sometimes none) above the anal angle of the
secondaries. Expanse, 3.00-3.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are well known. The caterpillar feeds
on the leaves of the papaw (<i>Asimina triloba</i>), and wherever
this plant is found the butterfly is generally common.</p>

<p><i>Ajax</i> ranges from southern New England, where it is very
rare, west and south over the entire country to the foot-hills of
the Rocky Mountains. It is very common in the lower Appalachian
region, and in southern Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and
Tennessee is especially abundant.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Papilio eurymedon</b>, Boisduval, Plate XLIV, Fig. 5, &#9794;
(Eurymedon).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This beautiful insect belongs to the same group
as the four succeeding species. In the style of the markings it
recalls <i>P. turnus</i>, but the ground-color is always pale whitish-yellow
or white, the tails of the hind wings are more slender,
and the white marginal spots on the under side of the fore wings
are fused together, forming a continuous band. There are other
differences, but these, with the help of the plate, will suffice for
the ready identification of the species. Expanse, 3.50-4.00
inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[ 309]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar resembles that of <i>P. turnus</i>,
but may be distinguished by its paler color and the much smaller
spots composing the longitudinal series on the back and sides,
and by the different color of the head. It feeds upon a variety
of plants, and is especially partial to <i>Rhamnus californicus</i>.</p>

<p>The species ranges from Mexico to Alaska, and eastward as
far as Colorado. It is abundant in the valleys of the Coast Range,
and I have found it very common in the ca&ntilde;on of the Fraser
River, in British Columbia, in the month of June.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Papilio rutulus</b>, Boisduval, Plate XLV, Fig. 1, &#9794; (Rutulus).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The insect very closely resembles the following
species in color and markings, but the female is never dimorphic
as in <i>P. turnus</i>, and the marginal spots on the under side of the
fore wings run together, forming a continuous band, as in <i>eurymedon</i>,
and are not separate as in <i>P. turnus</i>. By these marks it
may always be distinguished. Expanse, &#9794;, 3.50-4.00 inches;
&#9793;, 3.75-4.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described with accuracy by
W.H. Edwards in the second volume of his great work. The
caterpillar differs from that of <i>P. turnus</i> in many minute particulars.
It feeds on alder and willow. It is the representative
on the Pacific coast of its Eastern congener, the common Tiger
Swallowtail.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Papilio turnus</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate XLIII, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Fig. 2,
dimorphic form <b>glaucus</b>, Linn&aelig;us, &#9793;; Plate II, Figs. 15, 26, 28,
<i>larva</i>; Plate VI, Figs. 1-4, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Tiger Swallowtail).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The "lordly Turnus" is one of the most beautiful
insects of the Carolinian fauna. The plate shows the figures
about one third smaller than in life, but they are sufficient for the
immediate identification of the species. The species is dimorphic
in the female sex in the southern portions of the territory which
it occupies. The black form of the female was regarded for a
long while as a distinct species, until by the test of breeding it was
ascertained that some eggs laid by yellow females produced black
females, and that, conversely, eggs laid by black females often
produced yellow females. In Canada and northward and westward
in northern latitudes the dark dimorphic female does not
occur. A small yellow dwarfed form is common about Sitka,
whence I have obtained numerous specimens. Expanse, &#9794;,
3.00-4.00 inches; &#9793;, 3.50-5.00 inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[ 310]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The egg is outlined on p. 4, Fig. 3. It is green
or bluish-green, quite smooth, with a few reddish spots in some
specimens. The caterpillar feeds on a great variety of plants, but
has a peculiar preference for the leaves of various species of wild
cherry (<i>Cerasus</i>). The chrysalis is accurately portrayed in Plate
VI, Figs. 1-4.</p>

<p>The metropolis of this species seems to be the wooded forests
of the Appalachian ranges at comparatively low levels. It abounds
in southwestern Pennsylvania, the Virginias, the Carolinas, Kentucky,
and Tennessee. I have often found as many as a dozen of
these magnificent butterflies congregated on a moist spot on the
banks of the Monongahela. At Berkeley Springs, in West Virginia,
I counted, one summer day, forty specimens hovering over
the weeds and flowers in a small deserted field. The movements
of the butterfly on the wing are bold and rapid. Its flight
is dashing. Now aloft to the tops of the highest trees, now down
in the shadows of the undergrowth, hither and thither it goes,
often settling for a moment on some attractive flower, or staying
its flight to quench its thirst on the sandy edge of a brook, and
then away again over the fields and into the forests. In New
England it is not very abundant, and in the Gulf States, while
numerous, is still less common than about the head waters of the
Ohio.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Papilio daunus</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXXVIII, Fig. 2, &#9794;
(Daunus).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This magnificent species, which is even larger
than <i>turnus</i> (the figures in the plate are greatly reduced), resembles
the preceding species in color and markings, but may at
once be distinguished by the two tails on the hind wing and
the projection of the lobe at the anal angle of this wing. It is
found among the eastern valleys of the Rocky Mountain ranges,
and descends into Mexico. In Arizona it is quite common. Expanse,
4.00-5.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have not yet been thoroughly studied,
but what we know of them shows that the species is allied very
closely to its immediate congeners, and the caterpillar feeds upon
the same plants, principally <i>Rosace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Papilio pilumnus</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXXVIII, Fig. 3, &#9794;
(Pilumnus).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Resembling the preceding species, but smaller,
having the bands and black margins of the wings decidedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[ 311]</a></span>
broader, and the lobe of the anal angle of the hind wing so much
lengthened as to give the wing the appearance of being furnished
with three tails. Expanse, 3.80-4.30 inches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XL">Plate XL</a>.</span></div>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;All we know of these is derived from the
brief account given by Schaus in "Papilio," vol. iv, p. 100. Mr.
Schaus says that the larva "feeds on laurel."</p>

<p>The insect is Mexican, and only occasionally occurs in Arizona.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Papilio thoas</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate XLII, Fig. 4, &#9794; (Thoas).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is readily distinguished from its near
ally, <i>P. cresphontes</i>, by the greater and more uniform breadth of
the median band of yellow spots traversing both the fore and the
hind wing, and by the almost total absence of the curved submarginal
series of spots on the primaries. There are other points
of difference, but these are so marked as to make the determination
of the species easy.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have never been fully described, but we
know that the caterpillar feeds upon the leaves of the lemon, the
orange, and other plants of the citrus group.</p>

<p><i>P. thoas</i> is not common within the limits of the United States,
where it is generally replaced by the following species; but it
occasionally occurs in the hot lands of the extreme southern portion
of Texas.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Papilio cresphontes</b>, Cramer, Plate XLII, Fig. 3, &#9794;;
Plate II, Fig. 16, <i>larva</i>; Plate VI, Figs. 8-10, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Giant
Swallowtail).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The principal points of difference between this
and the preceding species, its closest ally, have already been
pointed out, and are brought into view upon the plate.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are quite well known. The caterpillar
feeds upon <i>Ptelea</i>, <i>Xanthoxylon</i>, and various species of <i>Citrus</i>. It
is very common in the orange-groves of Florida, where the people
call the caterpillar the "orange-puppy," and complain at times
of the ravages perpetrated by it upon their trees. It appears to
have been gradually spreading northward, and in quite recent
years has appeared at points in the Northern States where before
it had never been observed. It has been recently taken in Ontario.
It has become rather abundant in the vicinity of the city
of Pittsburgh, where no observer had seen it prior to the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[ 312]</a></span>
1894. It is one of the largest and most showy species of the genus
found within our faunal limits.</p>

<p>(9) <b>Papilio aliaska</b>, Scudder, Plate XLI, Fig. 1, &#9794; (The Alaskan
Swallowtail).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This interesting form of the species, known to
entomologists as <i>Papilio machaon</i>, Linn&aelig;us, and to every English
school-boy as "the Swallowtail," represents a colonization
from the Asiatic mainland of this insect, which is the sole representative
of the genus on English soil. It differs from the English
butterfly by having more yellow on the upper side of the
wings, and by having the tails of the secondaries much shorter.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Undoubtedly these are very much like those of
the forms found in Europe and Asia, and the caterpillar must
be sought upon umbelliferous plants.</p>

<p>Thus far this insect has been received only from Alaska, and
is still rare in collections.</p>

<p>(10) <b>Papilio zolicaon</b>, Boisduval, Plate XXXVIII, Fig. 1, &#9794;
(Zolicaon).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species is somewhat nearly related to the preceding,
but may at once be distinguished from it by the broader
black borders of the wings, the deeper black on the upper side,
and the longer tails of the secondaries. The figure given in the
plate is only two thirds of the natural size.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been fully described by Edwards,
and are shown to be much like those of <i>P. asterias</i>. The caterpillar,
like that of the last-mentioned species, feeds upon the
<i>Umbellifer&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p><i>Zolicaon</i> ranges southward from Vancouver's Island to Arizona,
and eastward to Colorado. It is more abundant in the
valleys and foot-hills than on the sierras.</p>

<p>(11) <b>Papilio nitra</b>, Edwards, Plate XLI, Fig. 2, &#9794; (Nitra).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This insect, which is still very rare in collections,
is very nearly related to the preceding species, it having, no
doubt, with the succeeding species, sprung from the same original
stock as <i>zolicaon</i> and <i>aliaska</i>.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The insect occurs in Montana and the portions of British
America adjacent on the north.</p>

<p>(12) <b>Papilio indra</b>, Reakirt, Plate XLI, Fig. 3, &#9793; (Indra).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished by the short tails of the secon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[ 313]</a></span>daries,
and the narrow bands of yellow spots on the wings
closely resembling those found in the same location on the wings
of <i>P. asterias</i>, &#9794;. Expanse, 2.50-2.75 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These still await description.</p>

<p><i>Indra</i> occurs on the mountains of Colorado, Nevada, and
California.</p>

<p>(13) <b>Papilio brevicauda</b>, Saunders, Plate XL, Fig. 5, &#9793; (The
Newfoundland Swallowtail).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;There are two varieties of this species&mdash;one with
bright-yellow spots, one with the spots more or less deeply
marked with orange-yellow on the upper sides of the wing.
The latter variety is represented in the plate. The form with the
yellow spots is common on the island of Anticosti; the other
occurs quite abundantly in Newfoundland. Expanse, 2.75-3.00
inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Both the caterpillar and the chrysalis show a
very strong likeness to those of <i>P. asterias</i>. The larva feeds on
umbelliferous plants.</p>

<p>The range of the species is confined to the extreme northeastern
part of our faunal territory.</p>

<p>(14) <b>Papilio bairdi</b>, Edwards, Plate XL, Fig. 2, &#9794; (Baird's
Butterfly).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This form, the male of which is represented in the
plate, is the Western representative of <i>P. asterias</i>, and is characterized
in general by the fact that the size is larger than that of
<i>asterias</i>, and the postmedian band of yellow spots is broader. The
female is generally darker and larger than that sex in <i>asterias</i>.
Expanse, 3.25-3.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Not unlike those of <i>P. asterias</i>. The caterpillar
feeds upon <i>Umbellifer&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The seat of this species or form is Arizona, whence it ranges
northward.</p>

<p>(15) <b>Papilio brucei</b>, Edwards, Plate XL, Fig. 4, &#9794; (Bruce's
Butterfly).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species, which is thought to be the result of
a union between <i>P. oregonia</i> and <i>P. bairdi</i>, is found in Colorado.
<i>Oregonia</i> is, unfortunately, not represented in our plates. It flies
in Oregon and Washington, where <i>P. bairdi</i> is not found. In
Colorado and adjacent regions meeting with the form <i>bairdi</i>, which
ranges northward from Arizona, hybridization has occurred, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[ 314]</a></span>
we have a fixed form breeding either toward <i>bairdi</i> or <i>oregonia</i>.
To this form, characterized by more yellow on the bands of the
wings than in <i>P. bairdi</i>, and less than in <i>oregonia</i>, Mr. Edwards
has applied the name <i>P. brucei</i>, in honor of Mr. Bruce of Lockport,
New York, who has done much to elucidate the problems
connected with the species. Expanse, 3.25-3.60 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been fully described by Edwards.
They are much like those of <i>asterias</i>, and the food-plants belong
to the same class.</p>

<p>Bruce's Butterfly is found quite abundantly in Colorado.</p>

<p>(16) <b>Papilio hollandi</b>, Edwards, Plate XL, Fig. 3, &#9794; (Holland's
Butterfly).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species or form, which belongs to the Asterias-group,
in the breadth of the yellow spots on the upper side
of the wings holds a place intermediate between <i>P. bairdi</i>
and <i>P. zolicaon</i>, between which it has been suggested that it
may be a hybrid, which has become fixed, and therefore a species.
It is characterized by the fact that the abdomen is always
striped laterally with yellow or is wholly yellow. Expanse, 3.25-3.50
inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;We know as yet but little of these.</p>

<p>The insect occurs in Arizona and northward to Colorado.</p>

<p>(17) <b>Papilio asterias</b>, Fabricius, Plate XL, Fig. 1, &#9794;; Plate
II, Figs. 17, 24, 27, <i>larva</i>; Plate VI, Figs. 13, 18, 19, <i>chrysalis</i>
(The Common Eastern Swallowtail).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male is well represented in the plate. The
female lacks the bright-yellow band of postmedian spots on the
primaries, or they are but faintly indicated. The species is subject
to considerable variation in size and the intensity of the
markings. A very remarkable aberration in which the yellow
spots cover almost the entire outer half of the wings has been
found on several occasions, and was named <i>Papilio calverleyi</i>
by Grote. The female of this form from the type in the author's
collection is represented in Plate XLI, Fig. 6. Expanse, 2.75-3.25
inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar feeds on the <i>Umbellifer&aelig;</i>, and
is common on parsley and parsnips in gardens. In the South
I have found that it had a special liking for fennel, and a few
plants in the kitchen-garden always yielded me in my boyhood

the Mississippi.</p>

<p>(18) <b>Papilio troilus</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate XLI, Fig. 5, &#9794;; Plate
II, Figs. 18, 19, 22, <i>larva</i>; Plate VI, Figs. 5-7, <i>chrysalis</i> (The
Spice-bush Swallowtail).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side of the male is accurately depicted
in the plate. The female has less bluish-green on the upper side
of the hind wings. Expanse, 3.75-4.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar lives upon the leaves of the
common spicewood and sassafras, and draws the edges of a
leaf together, thus forming a nest in which it lies hidden.</p>

<p>The insect is found throughout the Atlantic States and in the
Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p>(19) <b>Papilio palamedes</b>, Drury, Plate XLII, Fig. 1, &#9793; (Palamedes).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side of the wings is very accurately
depicted in the figure just cited. On the under side the predominant
tint is bright yellow. Expanse, 3.50-4.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are described by Scudder in the third
volume of his work on "The Butterflies of New England." The
caterpillar feeds on <i>Magnolia glauca</i>, and on plants belonging to
the order <i>Laurace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The insect ranges from southern Virginia, near the coast, to
the extreme southern end of Florida, and westward to southern
Missouri and eastern Texas.</p>

<p>(20) <b>Papilio philenor</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate XLII, Fig. 2, &#9794;; Plate
II, Figs. 13, 20, 21, <i>larva</i>; Plate VI, Figs. 14, 17, 20, <i>chrysalis</i>
(The Pipe-vine Swallowtail).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The figures in the plates obviate the necessity for
describing this familiar but most beautiful insect, the glossy
blue-green of which flashes all summer long in the sunlight about
the verandas over which the <i>Aristolochia</i> spreads the shade of
its great cordate leaves. Expanse, 3.75-4.25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar feeds upon the leaves of <i>Aristolochia
sipho</i> (the Dutchman's-pipe) and <i>Aristolochia serpentaria</i>,
which abound in the forest lands of the Appalachian region.</p>

<p><i>Philenor</i> is always abundant during the summer months in
the Middle Atlantic States, and ranges from Massachusetts to
Arizona, into southern California and southward into Mexico.
It is double-brooded in western Pennsylvania, and the writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[ 316]</a></span>
has found females ovipositing as late as October. The caterpillars
are familiar objects about houses on which the <i>Aristolochia</i>
is grown as an ornamental vine.</p>

<p>(21) <b>Papilio polydamas</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate XLI, Fig. 4, &#9794;
(Polydamas).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished by the absence of tails on the
hind margin of the secondaries. The butterfly recalls the preceding
species by the color of the wings on the upper side. On the
under side the fore wings are marked as on the upper side; the
hind wings have a marginal row of large red spots. Expanse,
3.00-3.50 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is dark brown, and in many
points resembles that of <i>P. philenor</i> in outline, but the segments
are spotted with ocellate yellow and red spots. It feeds on
various species of <i>Aristolochia</i>. The chrysalis resembles that of
<i>P. philenor</i>.</p>

<p>This lovely insect represents in the United States a great
group of butterflies closely allied to it, which are natives of the
tropics of the New World. It occurs in southern Florida and
Texas, and thence ranges southward over Cuba, Mexico, and
Central America.</p>

<h2>FAMILY V</h2>

<h3>HESPERIID&AElig; (THE SKIPPERS)</h3>

<p class="cen">"Bedouins of the pathless air."&mdash;H.H.</p>


<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The butterflies belonging to this family are generally
quite small, with stout bodies, the thorax strongly developed
in order to accommodate the muscles of flight. They are
exceedingly rapid in their movements. Both sexes possess six feet
adapted to walking, and the tibi&aelig; of the hind feet, with few exceptions,
have spurs. The lower radial vein of the hind wing in
many of the genera is lacking, or is merely indicated by a fold in
the wing. There is great variety in the form as well as in the
coloration of the wings.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The eggs, so far as we are acquainted with them, may
be said to be, almost without exception, more or less hemispherical,
with the flat section of the hemisphere serving as the base.
They are sometimes smooth, but not infrequently ornamented
with raised longitudinal ridges and cross-lines, the ornamentation
in some cases being very beautiful and curious.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillars are cylindrical, smooth, tapering
forward and backward from the middle, and generally possess
large globular heads. They commonly undergo transformation
into chrysalids which have an anal hook, or cremaster, in a loose
cocoon woven of a few strands of silk.</p>

<p>This family, the study of which presents more difficulties than
are presented by any other family of butterflies, is not very well
developed in the Pal&aelig;arctic Region, but finds its most enormous
development in the Nearctic and Neotropical Regions. It is also
very strongly developed in the Indo-Malayan and Ethiopian
Regions. There are, at the present time, in the neighborhood
of two thousand species belonging to this family which have been
named and described.</p>

<span class="ni">Sipping only what is sweet."</span>

<p class="quotsig"><span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>
</div></div>


<p>This subfamily is composed of closely related genera which are
found only in the New World. They may be easily recognized
by the large blunt club of the antenn&aelig;. The cell of the fore wing is
always very long, being two thirds the length of the costa; the
lower radial vein usually rises from the end of the cell, a little above
the third median nervule, and at a considerable
remove from the upper radial.
They are said when at rest to extend
all their wings horizontally.</p>

<p>But one genus belonging to this
subfamily is represented within the
limits of the United States.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus PYRRHOPYGE,</b><br />
<b>H&uuml;bner</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The neuration is as
represented in the cut, and need
not, therefore, be described at length. The club of the antenn&aelig;
is thickened, usually bluntly pointed and bent into a hook.</p>

<h2>SUBFAMILY HESPERIIN&AElig; (THE HESPERIDS)</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="quotsig"><span class="smcap">Drake</span>, <i>The Culprit Fay</i>.</p>
</div></div>


<p>This subfamily falls into two groups:</p>

<p><i>Group A.</i>&mdash;In this group the cell of the fore wing is always
more than two thirds the length of the costa; the lower radial
vein lies approximately equidistant between the third median
nervule and the upper radial. The hind wing is frequently produced
at the extremity of the submedian vein into a long tail or
tooth-like projection. The fore wing is usually furnished in the
male sex with a costal fold, but is never marked with a discal
stigma, or bunch of raised scales. The antenn&aelig; always terminate
in a fine point and are usually bent into a hook. The butterflies
when at rest, for the most part, hold their wings erect, though
some of them hold them extended horizontally.</p>

<p><i>Group B.</i>&mdash;In this group the cell of the fore wing is less than
two thirds the length of the costa, and the lower radial is always
emitted from the end of the cell near the upper angle, much nearer
to the upper radial than to the third median. The hind wings are
often somewhat lobed at the anal angle, but never produced as
in the first group. The antenn&aelig; are very seldom hooked.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus EUDAMUS, Swainson</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; terminate in a fine point bent into a
hook at the thickest part of the club. The cell of the fore wing
is very long. The discocellulars are inwardly oblique and on the
same straight line, the upper discocellulars being reduced to a mere
point. The lower radial is equidistant between the upper radial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[ 321]</a></span>
and the third median nervule. The hind wing is without the
lower radial and is always produced into a long tail.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is more nearly globular than is true in most of
the genera, but is strongly flattened at the base and is marked
with a number of transverse longitudinal ridges,
somewhat widely separated, between which are
finer cross-lines. The micropyle at the summit is
deeply depressed.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar is cylindrical, tapering
rapidly from the middle forward and backward.
The head is much larger than the neck and is distinctly
bilobed.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is provided with a
somewhat hooked cremaster, is rounded at the head,
humped over the thorax, and marked on the dorsal
side of the abdominal segments with a few small
conical projections. The chrysalis is formed between
leaves loosely drawn together with a few
strands of silk.</p>

<p>This genus is confined to the tropics of the New
World, and is represented in the extreme southern portions of
the United States by the species figured in our plate&mdash;<i>E. proteus</i>.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Eudamus proteus</b>, Linn&aelig;us, Plate XLV, Fig. 6, &#9793;; Plate
II, Fig. 34, <i>larva</i>; Plate VI, Fig. 23, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Long-tailed
Skipper).</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 152.</a>&mdash;Neuration
of the genus
<i>Eudamus</i>.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side of the wings is brown, glossed
with green at the base of both wings. The spots on the primaries
of both sexes are alike, and are well represented in the
plate. On the under side the wings are pale brown; the primaries
are marked as on the upper side; the secondaries have the
anal portion and the tail dark brown; in addition they are crossed
by a short dark band at the end of the cell, and another similar
but longer postmedian band, which does not quite reach the costa
and loses itself below in the dark shade which covers the anal portion
of the wing. About the middle of the costa of the hind wings
are two small subquadrate black spots. Expanse, 1.60-1.75 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The plates give us representations based upon
Abbot's drawings of the mature caterpillar and the chrysalis. The
student who desires to know more may consult the pages of
Scudder's "Butterflies of New England." The caterpillar feeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[ 322]</a></span>
upon leguminous plants, especially upon the <i>Wistaria</i> and various
species of <i>Clitoria</i> (Butterfly-pea). It makes a rude nest for
itself by drawing two of the leaves together with strands of silk.</p>

<p>The species is tropical and is found all over the tropics and
subtropical regions of the New World, but ranges northward
along the Atlantic sea-coast, being occasionally found as far north
as New York City, where it has been taken in Central Park.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus PLESTIA, Mabille</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The club of the antenn&aelig; is flattened, sickle-shaped,
terminating in a fine point. The male has a costal fold upon the
fore wing. The lower radial is nearer to the upper radial than
to the third median nervule. The hind
wing is produced into a short tail. The
fifth vein is wanting.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>This genus is peculiar to Mexico and
Central America. But one species is found
within our limits, and is confined to Arizona.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side is accurately depicted in the plate.
On the under side the wings are hoary. The spots of the upper
side reappear, the lower spots of the primaries being partially
lost in the broad honey-yellow tint which covers the inner margin
of that wing. The secondaries are crossed by obscure dark-brown
basal, median, and postmedian bands, portions of which
are annular, or composed of ring-like spots. The anal angle is
clouded with dark brown. Expanse, 1.50-1.60 inch.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_XLIV">Plate XLIV</a>.</span></div>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; have the club stout, gradually thickened,
tapering to a fine point, and abruptly bent into a hook.
The palpi are profusely covered with thick scales, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[ 323]</a></span>
third joint is almost entirely concealed. The fore wing of the
male is furnished with a costal fold; the hind wing is prominently
toothed at the extremity of the submedian vein.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;The egg is elevated, hemispherical;
that is to say, it is flattened at the base, rounded
above, its height being almost equal to the width.
It is marked by about ten narrow, greatly elevated
longitudinal ridges, which sometimes fork
below the summit, and between which are a
multitude of fine cross-lines. The micropyle is
greatly depressed.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar closely resembles
the caterpillar of the genus <i>Eudamus</i>, but the
head is not as strongly bilobed.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis likewise resembles the chrysalis of
the genus <i>Eudamus</i>; the cremaster, however, is not as strongly
hooked as in that genus.</p>

(The Silver-spotted Skipper).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>-This very common and beautiful insect may easily
be recognized from the figure in the plate. The broad, irregular
silvery spot on the under side of the hind wings distinguishes it
at a glance from all other related species in our fauna. Expanse,
1.75-2.00 inches.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>-These have been accurately described by several
authors, and a very full account of them is contained in
"The Butterflies of New England." The caterpillar feeds upon
leguminous plants, and is especially common upon the <i>Wistaria</i>,
which is grown about verandas, and on the common locust
(<i>Robinia pseudacacia</i>). The caterpillar makes a nest for itself in
the same manner as <i>Eudamus proteus</i>. Pupation generally takes
place among fallen leaves or rubbish at the foot of the trees upon
which the caterpillar has fed.</p>

<p>This butterfly has a wide range, extending to the Gulf,
south of a line passing from Quebec to Vancouver, and ranging
still farther south as far as the Isthmus of Panama. It is single-brooded
in the North, and double-or triple-brooded in the South.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Genus THORYBES, Scudder</b><br />

(<b>The Dusky-wings</b>)</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The club of the antenn&aelig; is not very heavy, hooked,
the hooked portion about as long as the rest of the club. The
palpi are directed forward, with the second joint heavily scaled,
and the third joint very small. The fore wing
may be with or without the costal fold in the male
sex. The cut gives a correct idea of the neuration.
The hind wing is evenly rounded on the outer
margin, sometimes slightly angled at the extremity
of the submedian vein.</p>

fine and not much elevated longitudinal ridges.
The micropyle covers the upper surface of the egg
and is not depressed.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar somewhat resembles that of the

Plate II, Figs. 25, 29, <i>larva</i>; Plate VI, Fig. 28, <i>chrysalis</i> (The
Northern Dusky-wing).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side is represented correctly in Plate
XLVIII. On the under side the wings are dark brown, shading
into hoary-gray on the outer margins. The hind wings are
crossed by irregular basal, median, and postmedian brown bands
of darker spots, shaded with deeper brown internally. The
translucent spots of the upper side reappear on the lower side of
the fore wings. Expanse, 1.60 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are elaborately described in the pages of
Dr. Scudder's great work. The caterpillar feeds on clover, <i>Lespedeza</i>,
and <i>Desmodium</i>.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Genus ACHALARUS, Scudder</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; and palpi are as in the preceding

(The Hoary-edge).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The general appearance of the upper side of the
wings strongly recalls <i>E. tityrus</i>, but the hoary edge of the secondaries
and the absence of the broad median silvery

the two forms. Expanse, 1.65-1.95 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;What is known of them may
be ascertained by consulting the pages of "The
Butterflies of New England." The caterpillar is
found on the leaves of <i>Desmodium</i> (Beggar's-lice).</p>

<p>The insect is rare in southern New England,
and ranges thence southward and westward to
Texas, being scarce in the Mississippi Valley north
of Kentucky, and apparently not ranging west
of Missouri.</p>

of this beautiful species, which, on the under side, has
the hind wings banded much as in <i>E. proteus</i>. Expanse, 2.00

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;What little we know of these is based mainly
upon the observations of Abbot, and there is an opportunity here
for some young naturalist to render a good service to science by
rearing the insect through all stages from the egg. The habits
of the larva are not greatly different from those of allied species.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Genus HESPERIA, Fabricius</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; are relatively short; the club is stout

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side is correctly
delineated in the plate. The under side of
the fore wings is much paler than the upper
side, but with all the spots and markings of that side reproduced.
The hind wings are creamy-white, crossed by median, postmedian,
and marginal irregular bands of ochreous, somewhat annular
spots. There is a triangular black spot at the anal angle of the
secondaries. Expanse, 1.15 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;We know little of these. The caterpillar
probably feeds on malvaceous plants, as do most of the species
of the genus.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Hesperia centaure&aelig;</b>, Rambur, Plate XLVII, Fig. 13, &#9794;
(The Grizzled Skipper).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side may easily be recognized by the
help of the figure in the plate. On the under side the wings are
darker than in the preceding species; the spots of the primaries
reappear on this side, the submarginal curved row of spots coalescing
to form a narrow white band, the white spot at the end
of the cell flowing around the dark spot, which it only partly incloses
on the upper side, and forming an eye-like spot. The
hind wings are brown, scaled with green, and crossed by basal,
median, and marginal bands of quadrate spots. The fringes are
whitish, checkered with gray. Expanse, 1.15 inch.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;On the upper side strongly resembling the preceding
species, but the inner row of white spots on the hind
wings is more complete. On the under side the fore wings are
black, crossed by a double row of white spots, as on the upper
side, these spots standing out conspicuously on the dark ground.
The hind wings on the under side are more or less ferruginous,
with the white spots more or less conspicuous. The fringes are
checkered white and gray. Expanse, 1.00 inch.</p>

of the wing and the paler under side, the secondaries being
marked somewhat as in <i>H. montivaga</i>. Expanse, 1.00 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Hitherto undescribed.</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Quite small. The hind wings on the upper side
are almost entirely dark gray, the only white mark being a spot
or two at the end of the cell. The fore wings are marked on this
side as in the two foregoing species. On the under side the
fore wings are blackish toward the base, with the costa, the
apex, and the outer margin narrowly whitish. The hind wings
below are pale, with an incomplete median band of white spots
and broad white fringes, which are not checkered with darker
color as in the preceding species. Expanse, .85 inch.</p>

<p>(7) <b>Hesperia nessus</b>, Edwards, Plate XLVII, Fig. 17, &#9794;
(Nessus).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This singularly marked little species, which probably
might be separated from this genus on account of the slender
and prolonged palpi, and no doubt would be by some of the
hair-splitting makers of genera, I am content to leave where it
has been placed by recent writers. It can be readily recognized
by the figure in the plate, as there is nothing else like it in our
fauna. Expanse, .80 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p><i>Nessus</i> occurs in Texas and Arizona.</p>

<p>There are a few other species of this genus found within the

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Easily distinguished from the preceding species
by the somewhat crenulate shape of the outer margin of the hind
wings, the white color of the under side of the abdomen, and
the different arrangement of the white spots on the fore wings, as
well as by the dark bands which cross both the fore and the
hind wings on the upper side. Expanse, .90-1.15 inch.</p>

by the white fringes of the wings and by the markings of
the under side. The primaries on the lower side are dark, tipped
at the apex with light gray, and in the female having the costa
and the outer margin broadly edged with light gray. The hind
wings are pale gray of varying shades, marked with a number
of large circular white spots on the disk and a marginal series of
small white spots. Expanse, &#9794;, .80-1.25 inch; &#9793;, 1.15-1.40

<p class="cen"><b>Genus THANAOS, Boisduval</b><br />

(<b>The Dusky-wings</b>)</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; have a moderately large club, curved,
bluntly pointed. The palpi are porrect, the third joint almost
concealed in the dense hairy vestiture of the second joint. The
neuration of the wings is represented in the cut.
The fore wing in the case of the male always has a
costal fold. The butterflies comprised in this genus
are all, without exception, dark in color, in a few

end of the egg is relatively larger and not as deeply
depressed below the surface. The sides are ornamented, as in
<i>Achalarus</i>, by raised vertical ridges, between which are numerous
cross-ridges; in a few cases the vertical ridges are beaded, or marked
by a series of minute globose prominences, upon the edge.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillars are cylindrical, tapering from
the middle forward and backward, marked with lateral and dorsal
stripes, with the neck less strangulated than in the preceding
genera.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;Not greatly differing in outline from the chrysalis
of the preceding genera, in most species having the outline of the

the under side as a series of pale-yellowish spots more or less
distinct. The hind wings have a double series of faint yellow
spots; these as well as the marginal spots of the primaries are
very distinct on the under side. Expanse, 1.25-1.60 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar feeds on oaks, <i>Galactia</i>, and
possibly <i>Baptisia</i>. The life-history has been only partially ascertained,
in spite of the fact that the insect has a wide range and is

<p>(2) <b>Thanaos icelus</b>, Lintner, Plate XLVIII, Fig. 17, &#9794;; Plate
VI, Fig. 27, <i>chrysalis</i> (The Dreamy Dusky-wing).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Prevalently smaller in size than the preceding species.
The under side of the wings is paler than the upper side,
and the outer third of both the primaries and secondaries is
marked with a profusion of small indistinct yellow spots, which
do not form well-defined bands as in the preceding species. On
the upper side of the fore wing the median area is generally
marked by a broad band of pale gray, but this is not invariably
the case. Expanse, 1.00-1.20 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described by Scudder. The
caterpillar feeds on a variety of plants, as the aspen, oaks, and
witch-hazel.</p>

<p><i>Icelus</i> ranges across the continent from Nova Scotia to Oregon,
and south to Florida and Arizona.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Thanaos somnus</b>, Lintner, Plate XLVIII, Fig. 2, &#9794; (The
Dark Dusky-wing).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;A little larger than the preceding species, especially
in the female sex. The male is generally quite dark, the
banding of the fore wing on the upper side obscured. The hind
wings have a row of light marginal and submarginal spots, more
distinct on the under side than on the upper. The female generally
is light gray on the upper side of the wings, with broad
median and submarginal bands of dark brown, tending to fuse or
coalesce at a point near the origin of the first median nervule.
Expanse, &#9794;, 1.25 inch; &#9793;, 1.50 inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[ 334]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species may be distinguished from <i>T. pacuvius</i>,
a near ally, by the more mottled surface of the secondaries,
which in <i>pacuvius</i> are almost solidly black; and from <i>T. martialis</i>,
another close ally, by the absence of the purplish-gray cast peculiar
to both sides of the wings of the latter species, and the less
regular arrangement of the bands of spots on the upper side of
the fore wings. The plate does not show these delicate but constant
marks of difference as well as might be desired. Expanse,
1.20-1.40 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Dr. Scudder has fully described these. The
caterpillar feeds on the columbine (<i>Aquilegia canadensis</i>).</p>

<p><i>Lucilius</i> ranges from New England to Georgia, is common in
western Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and extends westward
at least as far as the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Thanaos persius</b>, Scudder, Plate XLVIII, Fig. 1, &#9794;;
Plate VI, Fig. 34, <i>chrysalis</i> (Persius' Dusky-wing).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This is a very variable species, some specimens
being light and others dark in color. There is scarcely any positive
clue to the specific identity of the insect except that which is
derived from the study of the genital armature of the male, which
is a microscopic research capable of being performed only by an
expert in such matters. The student may be pardoned if, in attempting
to classify the species of this genus, and the present
species in particular, he should grow weary, and quote a few biblical
expressions relating to Beelzebub, the "god of flies." Expanse,
1.20-1.45 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar feeds on willows. Scudder has

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Closely related to the preceding species. The hind
wings on the upper side in the male sex are almost solid black,
the fringes paler. On the under side there is a double row of light
spots along the margin of the hind wing in both sexes. The
female is generally paler in color on the upper side than the male.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

Plate VI, Fig. 37, <i>chrysalis</i> (Martial's Dusky-wing).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side of the wings is paler than in most
species, and has a distinctly purplish-gray cast. The fore wings
are crossed by irregular bands of dark spots. The hind wings
on the outer half are profusely mottled with small pale spots.
All the light spots are repeated on the under side of both wings,
and are more distinct on this side than on the upper. Expanse,
1.25-1.40 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are partly known. The caterpillar feeds
on <i>Indigofera</i> and <i>Amarantus</i>.</p>

<p>The species ranges from Massachusetts to Georgia, and westward
to Missouri and New Mexico.</p>

<p>(8) <b>Thanaos juvenalis</b>, Fabricius, Plate XLVIII, Fig. 11, &#9793;;
Plate VI, Fig. 33, <i>chrysalis</i> (Juvenal's Dusky-wing).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Larger than the preceding species. The wings
have a number of translucent spots arranged as a transverse
series beyond the middle of the wing. They are far more distinct
and larger in the female than in the male. The under side
of the wings is paler than the upper side, and profusely but
indistinctly marked with light spots. Expanse, 1.35-1.60 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;For a full knowledge of these the reader may
consult the pages of "The Butterflies of New England." The
caterpillar feeds on oaks and leguminous plants of various
species.</p>

<p>This insect ranges from Quebec to Florida, and westward
as far as Arizona, where it appears to be common.</p>

<p>(9) <b>Thanaos petronius</b>, Lintner, Plate XLVIII, Fig. 7, &#9794; (Petronius'

the first median nervule. The outer third of the primaries is
pale, the inner two thirds very dark. The under side of the
wings of the male is uniformly dusky, slightly, if at all, marked
with lighter spots. The under side of the wings of the female
is less distinctly marked with light spots than is the case in
allied species. Expanse, 1.50-1.75 inch.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Thanaos</i> is one of the most difficult genera to work
out in the present state of our knowledge of the subject. The
species are not only obscurely marked, but they vary in the most
extraordinary manner. Except by a microscopic examination of
the genital armature, which can be carried on only when the
student possesses considerable anatomical knowledge and an
abundance of material, there is no way of reaching a satisfactory
determination in many cases.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>COLLECTIONS AND COLLECTORS</b></p>

<p>In almost every community there is to be found some one
who is interested in insects, and who has formed a collection.
The commonest form of a collection is exceedingly primitive and
unscientific, in which a few local species are pinned together in
a glass-covered box or receptacle, which is then framed and hung
upon the wall. Almost every village bar-room contains some
such monstrous assemblage of insects, skewered on pins, in
more or less frightful attitudes. As evidencing an innate interest
in the beauties of natural objects, these things are interesting, but
show a want of information which, as has been already pointed
out, is largely due to a lack of literature relating to the subject in
this country. In many of the schools of the land small collections,
arranged more scientifically, have been made, and some of the collections
contained in the high schools of our larger towns and
cities are creditable to the zeal of teachers and of pupils. There
is no reason why every school of importance should not, in the
lapse of time, secure large and accurately named collections, not
only of the insects, but of the other animals, as well as the plants
and minerals of the region in which it is located. Every high
school should have a room set apart for the use of those students
who are interested in the study of natural history, and they ought
to be encouraged to bring together collections which should be
properly arranged and preserved. The expense is not great, and
the practical value of the training which such studies impart to
the minds of young people is inestimable.</p>

<p>The great systematic collections in entomology in the United
States are for the most part in the hands of the museums and
universities of the country. The entomological collections of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[ 338]</a></span>
United States government at Washington are large and rich in
interesting material. The collections possessed by Harvard College
and the Boston Society of Natural History are extensive; so
are also the collections of the American Museum of Natural History,
the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and those
of the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh. The collection in the
latter institution is altogether the largest and most perfect collection
of the butterflies of North America in existence, and covers
also very largely the butterflies of the world, there being about
twelve thousand species of butterflies represented, including representatives
of all known genera.</p>

<p>The formation of great collections has always had a charm
for those who have possessed the knowledge, the time, and the
means to form them; and the ranks of those who are engaged in
the study of butterflies include many of the most famous naturalists,
among them not a few of noble rank. One of the most enthusiastic
collectors in Europe at the present time is the Grand
Duke Nicholas of Russia. The Nestor among German collectors
is Dr. Staudinger of Dresden. In France M. Charles Oberth&uuml;r of
Rennes is the possessor of the largest and most perfect collection
on French soil. In England there are a number of magnificent
collections, aside from the great collection contained in the British
Natural History Museum. These are in the possession of Lord
Walsingham, the Hon. Walter Rothschild, Mr. F.D. Godman,
Mr. Herbert Druce, Mr. H.J. Elwes, and others, all of whom
hold high rank in the domain of scientific research.</p>

<p>There are many men who make the collecting of natural-history
specimens a business. They are among the most intrepid
and indefatigable explorers of the present time. The late Henry
W. Bates and Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace were in early life leaders
in this work, and we are indebted to their researches for a knowledge
of thousands of species. Two of the most successful collectors
who have followed in their footsteps are Mr. Herbert H. Smith
and Mr. William Doherty, both of them Americans; Mr.
Smith one of the most enthusiastic and successful explorers in
South and Central America, Mr. Doherty the most diligent explorer
of the Indo-Malayan Region. The story of the travels and
adventures of these two men is a tale full of romantic interest,
which, alas! has been by neither of them fully told.</p>

<h2>SUBFAMILY PAMPHILIN&AElig;</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The <i>Pamphilin&aelig;</i> found in our fauna fall into two groups.</p>

<p><i>Group A.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; are not greatly hooked and generally
sharply pointed; the palpi have the third joint short and
inconspicuous; the cell of the fore wing is always less than two
thirds the length of the costa; the lower radial is somewhat nearer
to the third median nervule than to the upper radial. The hind
wing is often lobed. The lower radial in the hind wing is generally
lacking. The male never has a costal fold on the fore
wings, and but rarely is provided with a discal stigma.</p>

<p>But three genera belonging to this section of this subfamily
are found in our fauna, namely, the genera <i>Amblyscirtes</i>, <i>Pamphila</i>,
and <i>Oarisma</i>.</p>

<p><i>Group B.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; are sometimes curved, but never
hooked, the palpi having the third joint minute, sometimes horizontally
porrected. The cell of the fore wing is less than two
thirds the length of the costa. The lower radial arises much
nearer to the third median nervule than to the upper radial. The
hind wing is elongated, but never tailed. The male is never
provided on the fore wing with a costal fold, but is in many
genera furnished with a discal stigma on the fore wing. When in
a state of rest the majority of the species elevate their fore wings and
depress their hind wings, an attitude which is peculiar to the insects
of this group.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus AMBLYSCIRTES, Scudder</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; are short, with a moderately thick
club, crooked at the end; the third joint of the palpi is bluntly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[ 340]</a></span>
conical, short, and erect. The costa of the fore wing is straight,
slightly curved inwardly before the apex. The neuration is
represented in the cut.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Hemispherical.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;Not differing materially in its
characteristics from the caterpillars of other hesperid
genera.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;Somewhat slender, with the dorsal
and ventral outlines straighter than in any of the
preceding genera, and the dorsum very slightly
elevated in the region of the thoracic segments.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Amblyscirtes vialis</b>, Edwards, Plate
XLVII, Fig. 5, &#9794;; Plate VI, Fig. 40, <i>chrysalis</i> (The
Roadside Skipper).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This little species, an exceptionally bright example
of which is represented in the plate, may be known by the
dark color of the upper surface, almost uniformly brown, with a
few subapical light spots at the costa. In the specimen that is
figured these light spots are continued across the wing as a curved
band, but this is not usual. The wings on the under side in both
sexes are very much as on the upper side, save that both wings
on the outer third are lightly laved with gray. Expanse, 1.00
inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described with minute accuracy
by Dr. Scudder.</p>

<p>The Roadside Skipper ranges from Montreal to Florida, and
westward as far as Nevada and Texas. It is not a common species
in the valley of the Mississippi; it seems to be far more
common in southern New England and in Colorado. At all
events, I have obtained more specimens from these localities than
from any others.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Amblyscirtes samoset</b>, Scudder, Plate XLVII, Fig. 6, &#9794;;
Plate VI, Fig. 45, <i>chrysalis</i> (Pepper-and-salt Skipper).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This little species on the upper side has the
ground-color as in the preceding species; the fringes on both
wings are pale gray. There are three small subapical spots on
the fore wing, three somewhat larger spots, one on either side of
the second median nervule and the third near the inner margin,
and two very minute spots at the end of the cell. On the under
side the wings are pale gray, the white spots of the upper side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[ 341]</a></span>
of the fore wing reappearing. The hind wing is in addition
marked by a semicircular median band of white spots, a small
spot at the end of the cell, and another conspicuous white spot
about the middle of the costa. Expanse, 1.00-1.10 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar apparently feeds upon grasses.
We know as yet very little of the life-history of the insect.</p>

<p>It is found in Maine, New Hampshire, along the summits of
the Appalachian mountain-ranges as far south as West Virginia,
and is reported to be common in Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Amblyscirtes &aelig;nus</b>, Edwards, Plate XLVII, Fig. 7, &#9793;
(The Bronze Skipper).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This obscure little species has the upper side of
the wings somewhat tawny. The markings, which are similar
to those in <i>A. samoset</i>, are not white, but yellow. The wings
on the under side are darker than in <i>samoset.</i> The spots of the
fore wing are the same, but the spots on the under side of the
hind wing are different, and form a zigzag postmedian transverse
band, with a single small spot at the end of the cell, and another
of the same size beyond the middle of the costa. Expanse, 1.00-1.20
inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These are unknown.</p>

<p>The species occurs in western Texas and Arizona.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Amblyscirtes simius</b>, Edwards, Plate XLVII, Fig. 8, &#9794;
(Simius).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side of the male is correctly figured in
the plate. The wings on the under side are quite pale; the spots
of the fore wing reappear on the under side, and the fore wing is
blackish at the base; the hind wing has the angle at the base
broadly white, with a broad white blotch at the end of the cell,
and a semicircular curved band of obscure spots traversing the
middle of the wing. Expanse, &#9794;, .90 inch; &#9793;, 1.20 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The species was originally described from Colorado.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Amblyscirtes textor</b>, Edwards, Plate XLVII, Fig. 16, &#9794;,
<i>under side</i> (The Woven-winged Skipper).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This little species, the under side of which is accurately
delineated in the plate, needs no description to characterize
it, as its peculiar markings serve at once to distinguish it
from all other species. Expanse, 1.25-1.45 inch.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Genus PAMPHILA, Fabricius</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; are very short, less than half the
length of the costa. The club is stout, elongate, and blunt at its
extremity; the palpi are porrect, densely clothed with scales,
concealing the third joint, which is minute, slender,
and bluntly conical. The body is long, slender, and
somewhat produced beyond the hind margin of the
secondaries. The neuration of the wings is represented
in the cut.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Hemispherical, vertically ribbed, the interspaces
uniformly marked with little pitted depressions.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The body is cylindrical, slender,
tapering forward and backward; the neck less strangulated
than in many of the genera. The body is somewhat hairy;
the spiracles on the sides open from minute subconical elevations.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;Not materially differing in outline and structure
from the chrysalids of other genera which have already been described.</p>

<p>Only a single species belonging to the genus is found in
North America.</p>

once to distinguish it. It is wholly unlike any other species.
Expanse, 1.10 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;These have been described by Dr. Scudder and
Mr. Fletcher. The caterpillar feeds on grasses.</p>

<p>The insect ranges from southern Labrador as far south as the
White Mountains and the Adirondacks, thence westward, following
a line north of the Great Lakes to Vancouver's Island and
Alaska. It ranges southward along the summits of the Western
Cordilleras as far as northern California.</p>

are very short; the club is long, cylindrical, bluntly
rounded at the apex, not curved. The palpi are stout, the apical
joint very slender, elongated, and porrect. The
head is broad; the body is long and slender,
projecting somewhat beyond the posterior
margin of the secondaries. The neuration of
the wings is represented in the cut.</p>

(Powesheik).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;This species may be distinguished from its ally
<i>garita</i> by its larger size, the darker color of the upper side of the
wings, and the red markings on the costa of the fore wings. On
the under side the fore wings are black, edged on the costa and
outer margin for a short distance below the apex with light

<p class="cen"><b>EXCHANGES</b></p>

<p>One of the best ways of adding to a collection is by the method
known as exchanging. A collector in one part of the country
may find species which are rare, or altogether unknown, in another
part of the country. By a system of exchanges with
other collectors he is able to supply the gaps which may exist in
his collection. No one, however, cares to effect exchanges with
collectors who are careless or slovenly in the preparation of their
specimens, or inaccurate in naming them. A collector who contemplates
making an exchange should, as the first step, prepare
double lists, in one of which he gives the names and the number
of specimens of either sex of the butterflies which he is able to offer
in exchange; in the other he sets forth the things which he
desires to obtain. The first list is said to be a list of "offerta";
the second is a list of "desiderata." As an illustration of the
manner in which such lists may be conveniently arranged, I give
the following:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="5" summary="">
<tr><th>OFFERTA</th></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Papilio turnus,</td><td align="left">&#9794; 3; &#9793; 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Dimorphic var. glaucus,</td><td align="left">&#9793; 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Colias alexandra,</td><td align="left">&#9794; 4; &#9793; 6.</td></tr>
<tr><th>DESIDERATA</th></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Papilio nitra,</td><td align="left">&#9793;.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Papilio brevicauda, orange-spotted var.</td></tr>
</table>


<p>The collector who receives these lists of offerta and desiderata
will be able to decide what his correspondent has which he desires,
and what there may be in his own collection which the
correspondent wishes that he can offer in exchange; and the
process of exchange is thus immediately facilitated.</p>

<p>Persons who exchange insects with others should always be
extremely careful as to the manner of packing the specimens,
and the directions given in the introductory portion of this book
should be very carefully followed. Too much care cannot be taken
in preventing damage to specimens in transit.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus ANCYLOXYPHA, Felder</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;Very small, the antenn&aelig; very short, the club

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>The insect is found in southern California.</p>


<p class="cen"><b>Genus LEREMA, Scudder</b></p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The antenn&aelig; are as in the preceding genus; the
palpi have the third joint erect, short, conical. The neuration is
represented in the cut. The male has a linear glandular streak
on the upper side of the fore wing.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Hemispherical, covered with more or
less regularly pentagonal cells.</p>

<p><i>Caterpillar.</i>&mdash;The caterpillar feeds upon
grasses. The body is slender, tapering forward
and backward; the head is small.</p>

<p><i>Chrysalis.</i>&mdash;The chrysalis is slender, smooth,
with a tapering conical projection at the head,
and the tongue-case long and free, reaching almost
to the end of the abdomen.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Lerema accius</b>, Smith and Abbot, Plate
XLVIII, Fig. 8, &#9794;; Plate VI, Fig. 46, <i>chrysalis</i>
(Accius).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The male on the upper side is dark blackish-brown,
with three small subapical spots, and one small spot below these,
near the origin of the third median nervule. The female is exactly
like the male, except that it has two spots, the larger one
being placed below the small spot corresponding to the one on
the fore wing of the male. The wings on the under side are
dark fuscous, somewhat clouded with darker brown, the spots
of the upper side reappearing on the under side. Expanse, &#9794;,
1.40 inch; &#9793;, 1.50 inch.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Very little has been written upon the early
stages.</p>

<p>The butterfly ranges from southern Connecticut to Florida,
thence westward to Texas, and along the Gulf coast in Mexico.</p>

&#9793; (The Dusted Skipper).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;The upper side is accurately represented in the
plate. The wings on the lower side are as on the upper side, a
trifle paler and somewhat grayer on the outer margin. Expanse,
&#9794;, 1.15 inch; &#9793;, 1.25 inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[ 367]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Unknown.</p>

<p>It ranges through southern New England, westward to Wisconsin,
Iowa, and Nebraska, in a comparatively narrow strip of country.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Lerema carolina</b>, Skinner, Plate XLVI, Fig. 36, &#9794; (The
Carolina Skipper).</p>

<p><i>Butterfly.</i>&mdash;On the upper side the butterfly is as represented
in the plate. The spots are repeated on the under side of the
fore wing, but less distinctly defined. The costa is edged with
brownish-yellow. The hind wings on the under side are yellow,
spotted with small dark-brown dots. Expanse, &#9794;, 1.00 inch.
The female is unknown.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;Wholly unknown.</p>

<p>This species has thus far been found only in North Carolina,
and is still extremely rare in collections. The figure in the plate
represents the type. I have seen other specimens. I place it
provisionally in the genus <i>Lerema</i>, though it undoubtedly does
not belong here, and probably may represent a new genus.
Lacking material for dissection, I content myself with this
reference.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">Fig. 181.</a>&mdash;<i>Megathymus yucc&aelig;</i>, &#9793;.</span>
</div>

<p>This genus comprises butterflies having very stout bodies,
broad wings, strongly clubbed antenn&aelig;, very minute palpi. The
caterpillars are wood-boring in their habits, living in the pith and
underground roots of different species of <i>Yucca</i>. The life-history
of the species represented in the cuts has been well described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[ 368]</a></span>
by the late Professor C.V. Riley, and the student who is curious
to know more about this remarkable insect will do well to consult
the "Eighth Annual Report of the State Entomologist of
Missouri" (p. 169), or the "Transactions of the St. Louis Academy
of Science" (vol. iii, p. 323), in which, with great learning,
the author has patiently set forth what is known in reference to
the insect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p>The genus <i>Megathymus</i> is referred by some writers to the
<i>Castniid&aelig;</i>, a genus of day-flying moths, which seem to connect
the moths with the butterflies; but the consideration of the anatomical
structure of this insect makes such a reference impossible.
The genus properly
represents a subfamily of the
<i>Hesperiid&aelig;</i>, which might be
named the <i>Megathymin&aelig;</i>. The
species represented in our cuts
is <i>Megathymus yucc&aelig;</i>, Boisduval
and Leconte. There are a
number of other species of
<i>Megathymus</i> that are found in our Southern States, principally in
Texas and Arizona. They are interesting insects, the life-history
of which is, however, in many cases obscure, as yet.</p>

<p class="rt"><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>We here bring to a conclusion our survey of the butterflies of
North America. There are, in addition to the species that have
been described and figured in the plates, about one hundred and
twenty-five other species, principally <i>Hesperiid&aelig;</i>, which have
not been mentioned. The field of exploration has not by any
means been exhausted, and there is no doubt that in the lapse of
time a number of other species will be discovered to inhabit our
faunal limits.</p>

<p>The writer of these pages would deem it a great privilege to
aid those who are interested in the subject in naming and identifying
any material which they may not be able to name and
identify by the help of this book. In laying down his pen, at
the end of what has been to him a pleasurable task, he again renews
the hope that what he has written may tend to stimulate a
deeper and more intelligent interest in the wonders of creative
wisdom, and takes occasion to remind the reader that it is true,
as was said by Fabricius, that nature is most to be admired in
those works which are least&mdash;"<i>Natura maxime miranda in
minimis.</i>"</p>

<h2>SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>


<p>The first edition of this book having been nearly exhausted in
less than a month after publication, the author has not yet had
opportunity to avail himself of the criticisms of scientific friends
who are presumably looking for sins of omission and commission,
of which it is sincerely hoped they will acquaint him when
discovered. Thus far all criticisms have been of an approbatory
character, and have only expressed pleasure.</p>

<p>The writer is indebted to Mr. Harrison G. Dyar, the Honorary
Curator of the Department of Entomology in the United States
National Museum, for reminding him of the fact, which he had
carelessly overlooked, that the larva and chrysalis of <i>Eum&aelig;us
atala</i> (see p. 237) have been fully described by Scudder, "Memoirs
of the Boston Society of Natural History," vol. ii., p. 413, and
by Schwartz, "Insect Life," vol. i., p. 39. The caterpillar is found
abundantly upon the "coontie" (<i>Zamia integrifolia</i>, Willdenow),
and the insect, according to Schwartz, fairly swarms in the pine-woods
between the shores of Biscayne Bay and the Everglades.</p>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
